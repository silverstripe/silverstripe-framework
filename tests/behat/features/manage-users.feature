Feature: Manage users
  As a site administrator
  I want to create and manage user accounts on my site
  So that I can control access to the CMS

  Background:
    Given a "member" "ADMIN" belonging to "ADMIN group" with "Email"="admin@example.org"
    And the "member" "ADMIN" belonging to "ADMIN group2"
    And a "member" "Staff" belonging to "Staff group" with "Email"="staffmember@example.org"
    And the "group" "ADMIN group" has permissions "Full administrative rights"
    And the "group" "ADMIN group2" has permissions "Full administrative rights"
    And I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
    And I go to "/admin/security"


  Scenario: I cannot remove my admin access, but can remove myself from an admin group
    When I click the "Groups" CMS tab
      And I click "ADMIN group" in the "#Root_Groups" element
      And I should see the "Unlink" button in the "Members" gridfield for the "ADMIN" row
    Then I click "Groups" in the ".breadcrumbs-wrapper" element
      And I click the "Groups" CMS tab
      And I click "ADMIN group2" in the "#Root_Groups" element
      And I should see the "Unlink" button in the "Members" gridfield for the "ADMIN" row
    Then I click the "Unlink" button in the "Members" gridfield for the "ADMIN" row

      | Surname | Doe |
      | Email | john.doe@example.org |
    And I press the "Apply changes" button
    Then I should see a "Saved member" message
