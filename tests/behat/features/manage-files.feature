Feature: Manage files
  As a cms author
  I want to upload and manage files within the CMS
  So that I can insert them into my content efficiently

  Background:
    # Idea: We could weave the database reset into this through
    # saying 'Given there are ONLY the following...'.
    Given there are the following Folder records
    """
    folder1:
        Filename: assets/folder1
    folder1.1:
        Filename: assets/folder1/folder1.1
        Parent: =>Folder.folder1
    folder2:
        Filename: assets/folder2
        Name: folder2
    """
    And there are the following File records
    """
    file1:
        Filename: assets/folder1/file1.jpg
        Name: file1.jpg
        Parent: =>Folder.folder1
    file2:
        Filename: assets/folder1/folder1.1/file2.jpg
        Name: file2.jpg
        Parent: =>Folder.folder1.1
    """
    And I am logged in with "ADMIN" permissions
    # Alternative fixture shortcuts, with their titles
    # as shown in admin/security rather than technical permission codes.
    # Just an idea for now, could be handled by YAML fixtures as well
#    And I am logged in with the following permissions
#      - Access to 'Pages' section
#      - Access to 'Files' section
    And I go to "/admin/assets"
