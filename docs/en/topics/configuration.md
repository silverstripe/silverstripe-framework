# Common configuration through _config.php

## Introduction

SilverStripe doesn't have a global configuration-array or an interface with all available configuration-options. As all
SilverStripe logic is contained in classes, the appropriate place to configure their behaviour is directly in the class
itself. 

This lack of a configuration-GUI is on purpose, as we'd like to keep developer-level options where they belong (into
code), without cluttering up the interface. See this core forum discussion ["The role of the
CMS"](http://www.silverstripe.com/core-team-discussion/flat/2723) for further reasoning.

In addition to these principle, some settings are 
 * Author-level configuration like interface language or date/time formats can be performed in the CMS "My Profile" section (`admin/myprofile`). 
 * Group-related configuration like `[api:HTMLEditorField]` settings can be found in the "Security" section (`admin/security`).
 * Site-wide settings like page titles can be set (and extended) on the root tree element in the CMS "Content" section (through the [siteconfig](/reference/siteconfig) API).

## _ss_environment.php

See [environment-management](/topics/environment-management).

## mysite/_config.php

This file is detected in each folder by `[api:ManifestBuilder]`. This way, every toplevel-folder (=module)
can have independent configuration-rules.


Please note that this is the only place where you can put in procedural code - all other functionality is wrapped in
classes (see [common-problems](/installation/common-problems)).

You can call most static methods from _config.php - classes will be loaded as required. Here's a list - **this is
incomplete - please add to it** *Try to keep it in alphabetical order too! :)*

## Constants

Some constants are user-defineable within *_ss_environment.php*.

 | Name  |																| Description | 
 | ----  |																| ----------- | 
 | *TEMP_FOLDER* |														| Absolute file path to store temporary files such as cached templates or the class manifest. Needs to be writeable by the webserver user. Defaults to *sys_get_temp_dir()*, and falls back to *silverstripe-cache* in the webroot. See *getTempFolder()* in *framework/core/Core.php* | 

## User-level: Member-object

All user-related preferences are stored as a property of the `[api:Member]`-class (and as a database-column in the
*Member*-table). You can "mix in" your custom preferences by using `[api:DataObject]` for details.

## Permissions

See [security](/topics/security) and [permission](/reference/permission)

## Resource Usage (Memory and CPU)

SilverStripe tries to keep its resource usage within the documented limits (see our [server requirements](../installation/server-requirements)).
These limits are defined through `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time` in the PHP configuration.
They can be overwritten through `ini_set()`, unless PHP is running with the [Suhoshin Patches](http://www.hardened-php.net/)
or in "[safe mode](http://php.net/manual/en/features.safe-mode.php)".
Most shared hosting providers will have maximum values that can't be altered.

For certain tasks like synchronizing a large `assets/` folder with all file and folder entries in the database,
more resources are required temporarily. In general, we recommend running resource intensive tasks
through the [commandline](../topics/commandline), where configuration defaults for these settings are higher or even unlimited.

SilverStripe can request more resources through `increase_memory_limit_to()` and `increase_time_limit_to()`.
If you are concerned about resource usage on a dedicated server (without restrictions imposed through shared hosting providers), you can set a hard limit to these increases through
`set_increase_memory_limit_max()` and `set_increase_time_limit_max()`.
These values will just be used for specific scripts (e.g. `[api:Filesystem::sync()]`),
to raise the limits for all executed scripts please use `ini_set('memory_limit', <value>)`
and `ini_set('max_execution_time', <value>)` in your own `_config.php`.
