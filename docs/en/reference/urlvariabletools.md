# URL Variable Tools

## Introduction

This page lists a number of "page options" , "rendering tools" or "special URL variables" that you can use to debug your
SilverStripe applications.  These are consumed in PHP using the $_REQUEST or $_GET superglobals throughout the SilverStripe
core.

**General Usage**

Append the option and corresponding value to your URL in your browser's address bar.  You may find the [Firefox UrlParams extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1290) useful in order to debug a POST requests (Like Forms).

## Templates

 | URL Variable | | Values | | Description                                                     | 
 | ------------ | | ------ | | -----------                                                     | 
 | flush        | | 1,all  | | This will clear out all cached information about the page.  This is used frequently during development - for example, when adding new PHP or SS files. See below for value descriptions. | 
 | showtemplate | | 1      | | Show the compiled version of all the templates used, including line numbers.  Good when you have a syntax error in a template. Cannot be used on a Live site without **isDev**.  **flush** can be used with the following values: |
 | ?flush=1     | |        | | Flushes the current page and included templates |
 | ?flush=all   | |        | | Flushes the entire template cache |
