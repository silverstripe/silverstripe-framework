# Installing SilverStripe

## Download

SilverStripe is a web application. This means that you will need to have a webserver and database meeting its 
[requirements](server-requirements). We will take you through the setup of the server environment as well the application itself.

You can [download](http://silverstripe.org/download) SilverStripe as an archive or from [version control](from-source).

If you already have an installed version of SilverStripe, please see our [upgrading](upgrading) guide.

## Linux/Unix

*  [Install using Apache](webserver) - our preferred platform
*  [Install using Lighttpd](lighttpd) - fast, but a bit tricker to get going
*  [Install using Nginx](nginx) - Super fast at serving static files. Great for large traffic sites.

## Windows

We recommend that you use the free [Microsoft Web Platform installer](windows-pi).  
The more technically inclined can [install using IIS](windows-manual-iis) or [install using Apache/WAMP](windows-wamp).

## Mac OS X

Mac OS X comes with a built-in webserver, but you can also use MAMP [install using MAMP](mac-osx) or using MacPorts.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble, see [common-problems](common-problems) or post to the 
[SilverStripe forums](http://silverstripe.com/silverstripe-forum/).
