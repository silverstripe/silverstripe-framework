title: SilverStripe Documentation
introduction: Welcome to the SilverStripe Developer Documentation. This website is aimed at website developers looking to learn how to build and manage web applications with the SilverStripe Framework.

## Getting Started with SilverStripe

Before you start developing your first web application, you'll need to install the latest version of SilverStripe onto 
a web server. The [Getting Started](/getting_started) section will show you what 
[server requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) you will need to meet and how to 
[download and install SilverStripe](/getting_started/installation).

To check out the features that SilverStripe offers without installing it, read the [Feature Overview](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/) 
and play with the interactive [demo website](http://demo.silverstripe.org/).

##  Getting support

SilverStripe has an wide range of options for getting support. The [forums](http://www.silverstripe.org/community/forums/) 
and [IRC channel](http://irc.silverstripe.org/) are the best places to talk and discuss questions and problems with the
community. There are also several other websites with SilverStripe documentation to make use of. 

* The [API Documentation](http://api.silverstripe.org/) contains technical reference and class information. 
* The [User Help](http://userhelp.silverstripe.com) website contains documentation related to working within the CMS. 

New features, API changes and the development [roadmap](http://www.silverstripe.org/roadmap/) for the product are 
discussed on the [core mailinglist](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/silverstripe-dev) along with 
[UserVoice](http://silverstripe.uservoice.com/forums/251266-new-features).
