## Getting Started with Silverstripe

Before you start developing your first web application, you'll need to install the latest version of Silverstripe onto a
web server. The [Getting Started](/getting_started) section will show you what
[server requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) you will need to meet and how to
[install Silverstripe with Composer](/getting_started/composer).

To check out the features that Silverstripe offers without installing it, read
the [Feature Overview](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/)
and play with our [interactive demos](http://silverstripe.org/try).

## Building your first Silverstripe Web application

Once you have completed the [Getting Started](/getting_started) guide and have got Silverstripe installed and running,
the following [Tutorials](http://silverstripe.org/learn/lessons) will lead through the basics and core concepts of
Silverstripe.

Make sure you know the basic concepts of PHP7 before attempting to follow the tutorials. If you have not programmed with
PHP5 be sure to read
the [Introduction to PHP5 (zend.com)](http://devzone.zend.com/6/php-101--php-for-the-absolute-beginner).
