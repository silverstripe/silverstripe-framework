introduction: Welcome to the SilverStripe Developer Documentation. This website is aimed at website developers looking to learn how to build and manage web applications with the SilverStripe Framework.

## Getting Started with SilverStripe

Before you start developing your first web application, you'll need to install the latest version of SilverStripe onto 
a web server. The [Getting Started](/getting_started) section will show you what 
[server requirements](/getting_started/server_requirements) you will need to meet and how to 
[download and install SilverStripe](/getting_started/installation).

To check out the features that SilverStripe offers without installing it, read the [Feature Overview](http://www.silverstripe.org/software/) 
and play with our [interactive demos](http://silverstripe.org/try).
