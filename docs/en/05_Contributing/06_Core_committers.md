# Core Committers
The core committers team is reviewed annually, approximately, and new members are added based on the quality of their contributions to SilverStipe code and their outstanding community participation.

## House rules for the core committer team

The "core committers" consist of everybody with write permissions to our codebase.
With great power comes great responsibility, so we have agreed on certain expectations:

 * Be friendly, encouraging and constructive towards other community members.
 * Frequently review pull requests and new issues (in particular, respond quickly to @mentions).
 * Treat issues according to our [issue guidelines](issues_and_bugs).
 * Don't commit directly to core. Instead, raise pull requests (except for trivial fixes).
 * Only merge code you have tested and fully understood. If in doubt, ask for a second opinion.
 * Ensure contributions have appropriate [test coverage](../developer_guides/testing), are well documented, and meet our [coding conventions](/getting_started/coding_conventions).
 * Keep the codebase is a "releasable" state at all times (check our [release process](release_process)).
 * API changes and non-trivial feature changes should not be merged into release branches. 
 * API changes on master should not be merged until they have the buy-in of at least two core committers, or, even better, after a thorough discussion on the [core mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/silverstripe-dev)).
 * Be inclusive. Ensure that a wide range of SilverStripe developers can obtain an understanding of your code and docs, and you're not the only one who can maintain it.
 * Avoid `git push --force`, and be careful with your git remotes (no accidental pushes).
 * Use your own forks to create feature branches.
