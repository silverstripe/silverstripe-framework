## Reporting Bugs

If you have discovered a bug in SilverStripe, we'd be glad to hear about it -
well written bug reports can be half of the solution already!

Before submitting a bug:

 * Ask for assistance in our [community channels](https://www.silverstripe.org/community) if you're unsure if it's really a bug.
 * Search for similar, existing tickets.
   You can [list all issues across modules](https://www.silverstripe.org/community/contributing-to-silverstripe/github-all-core-issues),
   then add your search phrase at the start of the existing search filters (for example [all issues with label "type/ux"](https://www.silverstripe.org/community/contributing-to-silverstripe/github-all-open-ux-issues))
 * Is this a security issue? Please follow our separate reporting guidelines below.
 * Which modules does this issue belong to? Each one has its own issue tracker.
   If you are unsure, [create an issue](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/new) on the the "framework" repository.
   Note that [documentation issues](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues) are tracked in "framework" as well. 
 * Try to reproduce your issue on a [clean installation](/getting_started/composer#using-development-versions), maybe the bug has already been fixed on an unreleased branch?
 * The bugtracker is not the place to discuss enhancements, please use 
   the ["feature ideas" forum category](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/feature-ideas) and our [community channels](https://www.silverstripe.org/community).
   Only log enhancement tickets if they gather a large interest in the community
   and the enhancement is likely to be implemented in the next couple of months.

If the issue does look like a new bug:

 * Create an issue on the right module repository in GitHub
 * Describe the steps required to reproduce your issue, and the expected outcome. Unit tests, screenshots and screencasts can help here.
 * Describe your environment as detailed as possible: SilverStripe version, Browser, PHP version, Operating System, any installed SilverStripe modules.
 * *(optional)* [Submit a pull request](/contributing/code/#step-by-step-from-forking-to-sending-the-pull-request) which fixes the issue.

Lastly, don't get your hopes up too high. Unless your issue is a blocker 
affecting a large number of users, don't expect SilverStripe developers to jump 
onto it right way. Your issue is a starting point where others with the same 
problem can collaborate with you to develop a fix. 

## Feature Requests

<div class="warning" markdown='1'>
Please don't file "feature requests" as Github issues. If there's a new feature 
you'd like to see in SilverStripe, you either need to write it yourself (and 
[submit a pull request](/contributing/code/#step-by-step-from-forking-to-sending-the-pull-request) or convince somebody else to 
write it for you. Any "wishlist" type issues without code attached can be 
expected to be closed as soon as they're reviewed.
</div>

In order to gain interest and feedback in your feature, we encourage you to 
present it to the community through the [community channels](https://www.silverstripe.org/community).

## Reporting Security Issues

Report security issues to [security@silverstripe.org](mailto:security@silverstripe.org). 
See our "[Release Process](/contributing/release_process/#security-releases)" documentation for more info, and 
read our guide on [how to write secure code](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/).
