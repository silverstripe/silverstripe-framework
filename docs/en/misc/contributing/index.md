# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You can
participate by sharing  code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what
your skill level is, every contribution counts.

See our [high level overview on silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org/contributing-to-silverstripe)
on how you can help out.

 * [Writing and translating **documentation**](documentation)
