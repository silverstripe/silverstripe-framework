# Contributing

Any open source product is only as good as the community behind it. You can participate by sharing 
code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.

See our [high level overview on silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org/contributing-to-silverstripe) on how you can help out.

 * [Providing **code**, whether it's creating a feature or fixing a bug](code)
 * [Writing and translating **documentation**](documentation)
