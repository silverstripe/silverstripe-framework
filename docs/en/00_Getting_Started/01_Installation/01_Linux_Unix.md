# Installation on Linux, Unix and *nix like Operating Systems

SilverStripe should be able to be installed on any Linux, Unix or *nix like OS as long as the correct server software is installed and configured (referred to a *nix in this document from herein). It is common that web hosting that you may use for your production SilverStripe application will be *nix based, here you may also want to use *nix locally to ensure how you develop locally mimics closely your production environment.

Is important to ensure you check the [Server Requirements](/Getting_Started/Installation/Server_Requirements) list before acquiring and installing SilverStripe on your *nix server (locally or otherwise).

At a high level you will need a:
* Web server e.g. Apache, Nginx
* Database e.g. MariaDB, Postgres, MySQL
* PHP

##*nix installation guides on the web
There are a number of good step by step guides covering server setups and installing of SilverStripe on the various flavours of *nix systems. 

Note: Many of the following guides simply download SilverStripe as a zipped file. We recommend the use of [Composer](/Getting_Started/Composer/) once you get to the point of installing SilverStripe (though the choice is up to you). Always ensure you get the latest version if you are starting a new project.
