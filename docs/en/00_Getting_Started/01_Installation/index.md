<div class="notice" markdown="1">
SilverStripe ships with default rewriting rules specific to your web server. Apart from
routing requests to the framework, they also prevent access to sensitive files in the webroot,
for example YAML configuration files. Please refer to the [secure coding](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#filesystem) documentation for details.
