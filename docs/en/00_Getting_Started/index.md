title: Getting Started
introduction: Silverstripe is a web application. This means that you will need to have a webserver and database. We will take you through the setup of the server environment as well the application itself.

## Server Requirements

Silverstripe requires PHP 7.1 or newer. It runs on many webservers and databases, but is most commonly served using
Apache and MySQL/MariaDB.

If you are setting up your own environment, you'll need to consider a few configuration settings such as URL rewriting
and protecting access to certain files. Refer to our [server requirements](server_requirements) for details.

## Quickstart Installation

If you're running Apache with MySQL/MariaDB already, and know your way around webservers, follow these steps to get
started. Silverstripe is installed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), a package management tool for PHP that lets
you install and upgrade the framework and other modules. Assuming you've got this tool, run the following command to
install Silverstripe:

```
composer create-project silverstripe/installer my-project
```

Within the newly created `my-project` folder, point your webserver at the `public/` folder.

Now create a `.env` file your project root (not the `public/` folder). It sets up the minimum
required [environment variables](environment_management). Replace the placeholders as required:

```
SS_DATABASE_CLASS="MySQLDatabase"
SS_DATABASE_NAME="<database>"
SS_DATABASE_SERVER="localhost"
SS_DATABASE_USERNAME="<user>"
SS_DATABASE_PASSWORD="<password>"
SS_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME="admin"
SS_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD="password"
SS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="<dev|test|live>"
```

Now you should be able to build your database by running this command:

```
vendor/bin/sake dev/build
```

Your website should be available on your domain now (e.g. `http://localhost`). The CMS login can be accessed at `/admin`.

For more information on how to maintain your installation or install projects, check
out [Using Silverstripe with Composer](composer).
