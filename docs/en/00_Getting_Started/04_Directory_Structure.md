# Directory Structure

## Introduction

The directory-structure in SilverStripe is built on "convention over configuration", so the placement of some files and
directories is meaningful to its logic.

## Core Structure

Directory            | Description
---------            | -----------
`public/`            | Webserver public webroot
`public/assets/`     | Images and other files uploaded via the SilverStripe CMS. You can also place your own content inside it, and link to it from within the content area of the CMS.
`public/_resources/` | Exposed public files added from modules. Folders within this parent will match that of the source root location (this can be altered by configuration). 
`vendor/`            | SilverStripe modules and other supporting libraries (the framework is in `vendor/silverstripe/framework`)
`themes/`            | Standard theme installation location

## Custom Code Structure

We're using `app/` as the default folder.
Note that until SilverStripe 4.2, this directory was named `mysite/`,
and PHP code was stored in a `code/` rather than `src/` folder.

 | Directory             | Description                                                         |
 | ---------             | -----------                                                         |
 | `app/`           | This directory contains all of your code that defines your website. |
 | `app/_config`    | YAML configuration specific to  your application                    |
 | `app/src`        | PHP code for model and controller (subdirectories are optional)     |
 | `app/tests`      | PHP Unit tests                                                      |
 | `app/templates`  | HTML [templates](/developer_guides/templates) with *.ss-extension for the `$default` theme   |
 | `app/css `       | CSS files                                                           |
 | `app/images `    | Images used in the HTML templates                                   |
 | `app/javascript` | Javascript and other script files                                   |
 | `app/client`     | More complex projects can alternatively contain frontend assets in a common `client` folder |
 | `app/themes/<yourtheme>` | Custom nested themes (note: theme structure is described below)     |


Arbitrary directory-names are allowed, as long as they don't collide with
existing modules or the directories lists in "Core Structure".
Here's how you would reconfigure your default folder to `myspecialapp`.

*myspecialapp/_config/config.yml*

```yml
---
Name: myspecialapp
---
SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\ModuleManifest:
  project: 'myspecialapp'
```

on folder and file naming in SilverStripe core modules.

## Themes Structure

 | Directory                       | Description                                                     |
 | ------------------              | ---------------------------                                     |
 | `themes/simple/`                | Standard "simple" theme                                         |
 | `themes/<yourtheme>/`           | Custom theme base directory                                     |
 | `themes/<yourtheme>/templates`  | Theme templates                                                 |
 | `themes/<yourtheme>/css`        | Theme CSS files                                                 |

## Module Structure {#module_structure}

Modules are commonly stored as composer packages in the `vendor/` folder.
They need to have a `_config.php` file or a `_config/` directory present,
and should follow the same conventions as posed in "Custom Site Structure".

Example Forum:

 | Directory  | Description                                                         |
 | ---------  | -----------                                                         |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/`| This directory contains all of your code that defines your website. |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/code` | PHP code for model and controller (subdirectories are optional)     |
 | ...        | ...                                                                 |

Note: Before SilverStripe 4.x, modules were living as top-level folders in the webroot itself.
Some modules might not have been upgraded to support placement in `vendor/`

### Module documentation

Module developers can bundle developer documentation with their code by producing
plain text files inside a 'docs' folder located in the module folder. These files
can be written with the Markdown syntax (See [Contributing Documentation](/contributing/documentation))
and include media such as images or videos.

Inside the `docs/` folder, developers should organise the markdown files into each
separate language they wish to write documentation for (usually just `en`). Inside
each languages' subfolder, developers then have freedom to create whatever structure
they wish for organising the documentation they wish.

Example Blog Documentation:

 | Directory  | Description                                                         |
 | ---------  | -----------                                                         |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs` | |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/_manifest_exclude` | Empty file to signify that SilverStripe does not need to load classes from this folder |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/`       | English documentation  |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/index.md`	| Documentation homepage. Should provide an introduction and links to remaining docs |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/Getting_Started.md` | Documentation page. Naming convention is Uppercase and underscores. |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/_images/` | Folder to store any images or media |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/Some_Topic/` | You can organise documentation into nested folders. Naming convention is Uppercase and underscores. |
 | `vendor/silverstripe/blog/docs/en/04_Some_Topic/00_Getting_Started.md`|Structure is created by use of numbered prefixes. This applies to nested folders and documentations pages, index.md should not have a prefix.|


## Autoloading

SilverStripe recursively detects classes in PHP files by building up a manifest used for autoloading,
as well as respecting Composer's built-in autoloading for libraries. This means
in most cases, you don't need to worry about include paths or `require()` calls
in your own code - after adding a new class, simply regenerate the manifest
by using a `flush=1` query parameter. See the ["Manifests" documentation](/developer_guides/execution_pipeline/manifests) for details.

## Best Practices

### Making /assets readonly
