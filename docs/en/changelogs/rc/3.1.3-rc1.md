## Upgrading

### ExtraMeta fields can now only contain `meta` and `link` elements

Previously ExtraMeta fields could contain any HTML elements. From 3.1.3-rc1 the contents are filtered
on write to only allow `meta` and `link` elements. The first time after upgrading that you save a page
that has other elements in ExtraMeta they will be deleted.
