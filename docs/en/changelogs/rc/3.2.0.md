# 3.2.0 (unreleased)

## Overview

### CMS

 * Moved SS_Report and ReportAdmin out to a separate module. If you're using
composer or downloading a release, this module should be included for you.
Otherwise, you'll need to include the module yourself 
(https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-reports)

### Framework

 * API: Removed URL routing by controller name
 * Extensions are now considered when matching request URLs.

## Details

### API: Removed URL routing by controller name

The auto-routing of controller class names to URL endpoints
has been removed (rule: `'$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID': '*'`).
This increases clarity in routing since it makes URL entpoints explicit,
and thereby simplifies system and security reviews.

Please access any custom controllers exclusively through self-defined
[routes](/reference/director). For controllers extending `Page_Controller`,
simply use the provided page URLs.

	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		static $allowed_actions = array('myaction');
		public function myaction($request) {
			// ...
		}
	}

Create a new file `mysite/_config/routes.yml` 
(read more about the [config format](/topics/configuration)).
Your controller is now available on `http://yourdomain.com/my-controller-endpoint`,
after refreshing the configuration cache through `?flush=all`.

	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
  		rules:
    		'my-controller-endpoint//$Action' : 'MyController'


The auto-routing is still in place for unit tests,
since its a frequently used feature there. Although we advise against it,
you can reinstate the old behaviour through a director rule:

	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
  		rules:
    		'$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID':  '*'

### Extensions Included in URLs

Extensions are now included in URLs when handling requests. Previously SilverStripe would match
a request to the URL `/page` the same as a request to `/page.extension`. From 3.2 onwards, the
extension is included in the request URL.

If you have any URL handlers which do not expect the extension to be considered when being used,
you will need to update them.
