# 3.2.0 (unreleased)

## Overview

### CMS

 * Moved SS_Report and ReportAdmin out to a separate module. If you're using
composer or downloading a release, this module should be included for you.
Otherwise, you'll need to include the module yourself 
(https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-reports)

### Framework

 * API: Removed URL routing by controller name

## Details

### API: Removed URL routing by controller name

The auto-routing of controller class names to URL endpoints
has been removed (rule: `'$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID': '*'`).
This increases clarity in routing since it makes URL entpoints explicit,
and thereby simplifies system and security reviews.

Please access any custom controllers exclusively through self-defined
[routes](/reference/director). For controllers extending `Page_Controller`,
simply use the provided page URLs.

	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		static $allowed_actions = array('myaction');
		public function myaction($request) {
			// ...
		}
	}

Create a new file `mysite/_config/routes.yml` 
(read more about the [config format](/topics/configuration)).
Your controller is now available on `http://yourdomain.com/my-controller-endpoint`,
after refreshing the configuration cache through `?flush=all`.

	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
  		rules:
    		'my-controller-endpoint//$Action' : 'MyController'


The auto-routing is still in place for unit tests,
since its a frequently used feature there. Although we advise against it,
you can reinstate the old behaviour through a director rule:

	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
  		rules:
    		'$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID':  '*'
