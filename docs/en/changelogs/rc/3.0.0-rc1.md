 * 2012-06-04 [119739d](https://github.com/silverstripe/sapphire/commit/119739d) If a DataObject has a many_many to a SiteTree subclass, and that subclass has no database fields defined, and $this-&gt;name is "ID", this function will errantly return "SiteTreeSubClass.ID", which can never exist in a search query, since there is no such table as SiteTreeSubClass. The problem is that DataObject::hasOwnTableDatabaseField() is a little eager when passed an argument of "ID." It doesn't check to see if the object has its own table first. (unclecheese)
