# 3.0.1-rc2 #

## Overview ##

3.0.1 RC2 fixes a CMS regression since 3.0.0 where Add Forms of GridField would require
a full CMS refresh after visiting, most obviously affecting the "Add Member" area of 
the Security admin panel.

In addition it restores GridField image embedding functionality from the 3.0 beta series 
that regressed in 3.0.0, most obviously restoring the image thumbnails to the Files
admin panel.

## Upgrading ##

There should be no changes required to upgrade from 3.0.0 or 3.0.1-rc1

See [3.0.0](/changelogs/3.0.0) for previous details.
