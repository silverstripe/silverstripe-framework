# 3.0.4

## Overview

 * Changed `dev/tests/setdb` and `dev/tests/startsession` from session to cookie storage.

## Upgrading

 * If you are using `dev/tests/setdb` and `dev/tests/startsession`,
   you'll need to configure a secure token in order to encrypt the cookie value:
   Simply run `sake dev/generatesecuretoken` and add the resulting code to your `mysite/_config.php`.
   Note that this functionality now requires the PHP `mcrypt` extension.
