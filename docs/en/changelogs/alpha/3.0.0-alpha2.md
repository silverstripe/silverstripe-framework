# 3.0.0-alpha2 #

## Overview ##

 - CMS: CMS JavaScript performance and perceived rendering improvements 
 - CMS: New dedicated "Add page" interface with page type descriptions
 - CMS: Improved "Insert Link" dialog with cleaner styles
 - CMS: Selected tabs and collapsed panels are now stored in a Cookie for a more consistent interface when returning later to the CMS
 - Framework: Support for multibyte page URLs (e.g. with German Umlauts). Flexible URL filtering through new URLSegmentFilter API
 - Framework: Customizeable HTML attributes on Form and FormField (which allows better usage of HTML5 and data attributes)
 - New ORM: All SS_List implementors support filter(), exclude() and sort() methods
 - New ORM: DataQuery and SQLQuery supports whereAny() for doing "OR" queries
 - New ORM: DataList supports canFilterBy()
 - GridField can be altered by attaching components for actions and view output. 
 - Folders are using GridField for CMS (and thereby the Asset admin).

See [3.0.0-alpha1](3.0.0-alpha1) for previous details.

## Details ##

### New ORM Better at handling filtering

DataList handles filtering in a more fluent way than using raw where calls. The below example shows an example

	:::php
	DataList::create('Member')->filter(array('FirstName' => 'Sam'))->exclude('Surname', 'Magnusson')->sort('Age');

When this query is executed it will contain all members with firstname of Sam but not with lastname Magnusson sorted by age ascending

For more information see documentation at [/topics/datamodel](../../topics/datamodel).

### Grid Field 

GridField has changed since 3.0.0-alpha1 to be more flexible. Any previous implementation are broken
and need to be changed according to the new API.

For implementation details see documentation at [/topics/grid-field](../../topics/grid-field).

## Upgrading ##

See [3.0.0 upgrading guide](../3.0.0) for further details.

 * 2011-12-18 [05d19d9](https://github.com/silverstripe/sapphire/commit/05d19d9) Revert "MINOR Use json_decode() instead of the Services_JSON class if the function exists." - it breaks assumptions around Convert::json2array() only converting the *first* level of an object structure into an array, which in turn fails CMSMainTest and LeftAndMainTest (as well as some UI functionality relying on it). In order to introduce this change we have to fix these issues in a backwards compatible manner. (Ingo Schommer)
