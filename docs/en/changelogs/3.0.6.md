# 3.0.6 (Not yet released)

## Overview

 * Security: Require ADMIN for `?flush=1` (stop denial of service attacks)
 ([#1692](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/1692))

## Details

### Security: Require ADMIN for ?flush=1

Flushing the various manifests (class, template, config) is performed through a GET
parameter (`flush=1`). Since this action requires more server resources than normal requests,
it can facilitate [denial-of-service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).
To prevent this, the action is only executed in the following cases:

 * The [environment](/topics/environment-management) is in "dev mode"
 * The request is executed through CLI
 * A user is logged in with ADMIN permissions
 * A referenced class can't be found in the manifest

This applies to both `flush=1` and `flush=all`, technically we only check for the existance
of any parameter value.

## Upgrading

 * If you have created your own composite database fields, then you should amend `setValue()` to allow the passing of an object (usually `DataObject`) as well as an array.
