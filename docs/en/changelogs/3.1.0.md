# 3.1.0 (unreleased)

## Overview ##

### CMS

 * "Split view" editing with side-by-side preview of the edited website
 * Resizing of preview to common screen widths ("desktop", "tablet" and "smartphone")
 * Decluttered "Edit Page" buttons by moving minor actions into a "more options" panel
 * Auto-detect CMS changes and highlight the save button for better informancy
 * Display "last edited" and "last published" data for pages in CMS
 * CMS form fields now support help text through `setDescription()`, both inline and as tooltips
 * Removed SiteTree "MetaTitle" and "MetaKeywords" fields
 * More legible and simplified tab and menu styling in the CMS

### Framework

 * `DataList` and `ArrayList` are now immutable, they'll return cloned instances on modification
 * Behaviour testing support through [Behat](http://behat.org), with CMS test coverage 
   (see the [SilverStripe Behat Extension]() for details)
 * Removed legacy table APIs (e.g. `TableListField`), use GridField instead
 * Deny URL access if `Controller::$allowed_actions` is undefined
 * Removed support for "*" rules in `Controller::$allowed_actions`
 * Removed support for overriding rules on parent classes through `Controller::$allowed_actions`
 * `RestfulService` verifies SSL peers by default
 * Editing of relation table data (`$many_many_extraFields`) in `GridField`
 * Optional integration with ImageMagick as a new image manipulation backend
 * Support for PHP 5.4's built-in webserver
 * Support for [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) dependency manager (also works with 3.0)

## Upgrading

### Static configuration properties are now immutable, you must use Config API.

A common SilverStripe pattern is to use a static variable on a class to define a configuration parameter.
The configuration system added in SilverStripe 3.0 builds on this by using this static variable as a way
of defining the default value.

In SilverStripe 3.0, it was possible to edit this value at run-time and have the change propagate into the
configuration system.  This is no longer the case, for performance reasons.

Many of the configuration variables have been change to "private" so that attempts to change them throw an
error, but if you do have a configuration static that is able to be changed, and you change it, then the
configuration system will silently ignore it.

Please change all run-time manipulation of configuration to use `Config::inst()->update()` or
`$this->config()->update()`.  For more information about how to use the config system, see the 
["Configuration" topic](/topic/configuration).

### Deny URL access if `Controller::$allowed_actions` is undefined or empty array

In order to make controller access checks more consistent and easier to
understand, the routing will require definition of `$allowed_actions`
on your own `Controller` subclasses if they contain any actions
accessible through URLs, or any forms.

	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		// This action is now denied because no $allowed_actions are specified
		public function myaction($request) {}
	}

Please review all rules governing allowed actions in the
["controller" topic](/topics/controller).

### Removed support for "*" rules in `Controller::$allowed_actions`

The wildcard ('*') character allowed to define fallback rules
in case they weren't explicitly defined. This caused a lot of confusion,
particularly around inherited rules. We've decided to remove the feature,
you'll need to specificy each accessible action individually.

	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		public static $allowed_actions = array('*' => 'ADMIN');
		// Always denied because not explicitly listed in $allowed_actions
		public function myaction($request) {}
		// Always denied because not explicitly listed in $allowed_actions
		public function myotheraction($request) {}
	}

Please review all rules governing allowed actions in the
["controller" topic](/topics/controller).

### Removed support for overriding rules on parent classes through `Controller::$allowed_actions`

Since 3.1, the `$allowed_actions` definitions only apply
to methods defined on the class they're also defined on.
Overriding inherited access definitions is no longer possible.

	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		public static $allowed_actions = array('myaction' => 'ADMIN');
		public function myaction($request) {}
	}
	class MySubController extends MyController {
		// No longer works
		public static $allowed_actions = array('myaction' => 'CMS_ACCESS_CMSMAIN');
	}

This also applies for custom implementations of `handleAction()` and `handleRequest()`,
which now have to be listed in the `$allowed_actions` specifically.
It also restricts `Extension` classes applied to controllers, which now
can only grant or deny access or methods they define themselves.

New approach with the [Config API](/topics/configuration)

	:::php
	class MySubController extends MyController {
		public function init() {
			parent::init();

			Config::inst()->update('MyController', 'allowed_actions',
				array('myaction' => 'CMS_ACCESS_CMSMAIN')
			);
		}
	}

Please review all rules governing allowed actions in the
["controller" topic](/topics/controller).

### Grouped CMS Buttons

The CMS buttons are now grouped, in order to hide minor actions by default and declutter the interface.
This required changing the form field structure from a simple `FieldList`
to a `FieldList` which contains a `CompositeField` for all "major actions",
and a `TabSet` with a single tab for all "minor actions".
If you have previously added, removed or altered built-in CMS actions in any way,
you'll need to adjust your code.

	:::php
	class MyPage extends Page {
		function getCMSActions() {
			$actions = parent::getCMSActions();

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (old)
			$actions->push(new FormAction('MyAction')); 

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (new)
			$actions->insertAfter(new FormAction('MyAction'), 'MajorActions');

			// Removing an action, both toplevel and nested (no change required)
			$actions->removeByName('action_unpublish'); 

			// Inserting a new minor action (new)
			$actions->addFieldToTab(
				'Root.ActionMenus.MoreOptions',
				new FormAction('MyMinorAction')
			);

			// Finding a toplevel action (no change required)
			$match = $actions->dataFieldByName('action_save');

			// Finding a nested action (new)
			$match = $actions->fieldByName('ActionMenus.MoreOptions')
				->fieldByName('action_MyMinorAction'); 

			return $actions;
		}
	}

### GridField and ModelAdmin Permission Checks

`GridFieldDetailForm` now checks for `canEdit()` and `canDelete()` permissions
on your model. `GridFieldAddNewButton` checks `canCreate()`.
The default implementation requires `ADMIN` permissions.
You'll need to loosen those permissions if you want other users with CMS
access to interact with your data.
Since `GridField` is used in `ModelAdmin`, this change will affect both classes.

	Example: Require "CMS: Pages section" access

	:::php
	class MyModel extends DataObject {
		public function canView($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canEdit($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canDelete($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canCreate($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}

You can also implement [custom permission codes](/topics/permissions).
For 3.1.0 stable, we aim to further simplify the permission definitions,
in order to reduce the boilerplate code required to get a model editable in the CMS.

Note: GridField is already relying on the permission checks performed
through the CMS controllers, providing a simple level of security.

### RestfulService verifies SSL peers by default

This makes the implementation "secure by default", by removing
the call to `curl_setopt(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false)`.
Failing to validate SSL peers makes HTTP requests vulnerable to man in the middle attacks.
The underlying `curl` library relies on the operating system for the resulting CA certificate
verification. On some systems (mainly Windows), these certificates are not available on
a standard PHP installation, and need to be added manually through `CURLOPT_CAINFO`.
Although it is not recommended, you can restore the old insecure behaviour with
the following configuration: `RestfulService::set_default_curl_option(CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false)`.

### Other

 * `TableListField`, `ComplexTableField`, `TableField`, `HasOneComplexTableField`, `HasManyComplexTableField` and `ManyManyComplexTableField` have been removed from the core and placed into a module called "legacytablefields" located at https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/legacytablefields
 * `prototype.js` and `behaviour.js` have been removed from the core, they are no longer used. If you have custom code relying on these two libraries, please update your code to include the files yourself
 * `Object::has_extension()` and `Object::add_extension()` deprecated in favour of using late static binding, please use `{class}::has_extension()` and `{class}::add_extension()` instead, where {class} is the class name of your DataObject class.
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaKeywords` since they are irrelevant in terms of SEO ([seomoz article](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/keywords-meta-tag-in-web-search/)) and general page informancy
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaTitle` as a means to customize the window title, use `SiteTree.Title` instead
 * Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
 * Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
   `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
 * Removed `Member_ProfileForm`, use `CMSProfileController` instead
 * `SiteTree::$nested_urls` enabled by default. To disable, call `SiteTree::disable_nested_urls()`.
 * Removed CMS permission checks from `File->canEdit()` and `File->canDelete()`. If you have unsecured controllers relying on these permissions, please override them through a `DataExtension`.
 * Moved email bounce handling to new ["emailbouncehandler" module](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-emailbouncehandler),
   including `Email_BounceHandler` and `Email_BounceRecord` classes,
   as well as the `Member->Bounced` property. 
 * Deprecated global email methods `htmlEmail()` and `plaintextEmail`, as well as various email helper methods like `encodeMultipart()`. Use the `Email` API, or the `Mailer` class where applicable.
 * Removed non-functional `$inlineImages` option for sending emails 
 * Removed support for keyed arrays in `SelectionGroup`, use new `SelectionGroup_Item` object
   to populate the list instead (see [API docs](api:SelectionGroup)).
 * `FormField->setDescription()` now renders in a `<span class="description">` by default, rather than a `title` attribute * Removed `Form->Name()`: Use getName()
 * Removed `FormField->setContainerFieldSet()`: Use setContainerFieldList()
 * Removed `FormField->rootFieldSet()`: Use rootFieldList()
 * Removed `Group::map()`: Use DataList::("Group")->map()
 * Removed `Member->generateAutologinHash()`: Tokens are no longer saved directly into the database in plaintext. Use the return value of the Member::generateAutologinTokenAndHash to get the token
 * Removed `Member->sendInfo()`: use Member_ChangePasswordEmail or Member_ForgotPasswordEmail directly
 * Removed `SQLMap::map()`: Use DataList::("Member")->map()
 * Removed `SQLMap::mapInGroups()`: Use Member::map_in_groups()
 * Removed `PasswordEncryptor::register()/unregister()`: Use config system instead
 * Methods on DataList and ArrayList that used to both modify the existing list & return a new version now just return a new version. Make sure you change statements like `$list->filter(...)` to $`list = $list->filter(...)` for these methods:
   - `ArrayList#reverse`
   - `ArrayList#sort`
   - `ArrayList#filter`
   - `ArrayList#exclude`
   - `DataList#where`
   - `DataList#limit`
   - `DataList#sort`
   - `DataList#addFilter`
   - `DataList#applyFilterContext`
   - `DataList#innerJoin`
   - `DataList#leftJoin`
   - `DataList#find`
   - `DataList#byIDs`
   - `DataList#reverse`
 * `DataList#dataQuery` has been changed to return a clone of the query, and so can't be used to modify the list's query directly. Use `DataList#alterDataQuery` instead to modify dataQuery in a safe manner.
 * `ScheduledTask`, `QuarterHourlyTask`, `HourlyTask`, `DailyTask`, `MonthlyTask`, `WeeklyTask` and
	 `YearlyTask` are deprecated, please extend from `BuildTask` or `CliController`,
	 and invoke them in self-defined frequencies through Unix cronjobs etc.
