# 3.1.0 (unreleased)

## Overview ##

### CMS

 * "Split view" editing with side-by-side preview of the edited website
 * Resizing of preview to common screen widths ("desktop", "tablet" and "smartphone")
 * Decluttered "Edit Page" buttons by moving minor actions into a "more options" panel
 * Auto-detect CMS changes and highlight the save button for better informancy
 * Display "last edited" and "last published" data for pages in CMS
 * CMS form fields now support help text through `setDescription()`, both inline and as tooltips
 * Removed SiteTree "MetaTitle" and "MetaKeywords" fields
 * More legible and simplified tab and menu styling in the CMS

### Framework

 * `DataList` and `ArrayList` are now immutable, they'll return cloned instances on modification
 * Behaviour testing support through [Behat](http://behat.org), with CMS test coverage 
   (see the [SilverStripe Behat Extension]() for details)
 * Removed legacy table APIs (e.g. `TableListField`), use GridField instead
 * Editing of relation table data (`$many_many_extraFields`) in `GridField`
 * Optional integration with ImageMagick as a new image manipulation backend
 * Support for PHP 5.4's built-in webserver
 * Support for [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) dependency manager (also works with 3.0)

## Upgrading

### Grouped CMS Buttons

The CMS buttons are now grouped, in order to hide minor actions by default and declutter the interface.
This required changing the form field structure from a simple `FieldList`
to a `FieldList` which contains a `CompositeField` for all "major actions",
and a `TabSet` with a single tab for all "minor actions".
If you have previously added, removed or altered built-in CMS actions in any way,
you'll need to adjust your code.

	:::php
	class MyPage extends Page {
		function getCMSActions() {
			$actions = parent::getCMSActions();

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (old)
			$actions->push(new FormAction('MyAction')); 

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (new)
			$actions->insertAfter(new FormAction('MyAction'), 'MajorActions');

			// Removing an action, both toplevel and nested (no change required)
			$actions->removeByName('action_unpublish'); 

			// Inserting a new minor action (new)
			$actions->addFieldToTab(
				'Root.ActionMenus.MoreOptions',
				new FormAction('MyMinorAction')
			);

			// Finding a toplevel action (no change required)
			$match = $actions->dataFieldByName('action_save');

			// Finding a nested action (new)
			$match = $actions->fieldByName('ActionMenus.MoreOptions')
				->fieldByName('action_MyMinorAction'); 

			return $actions;
		}
	}

### GridField and ModelAdmin Permission Checks

`GridFieldDetailForm` now checks for `canEdit()` and `canDelete()` permissions
on your model. `GridFieldAddNewButton` checks `canCreate()`.
The default implementation requires `ADMIN` permissions.
You'll need to loosen those permissions if you want other users with CMS
access to interact with your data.
Since `GridField` is used in `ModelAdmin`, this change will affect both classes.

	Example: Require "CMS: Pages section" access

	:::php
	class MyModel extends DataObject {
		public function canView($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canEdit($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canDelete($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}
		public function canCreate($member = null) {
			return Permission::check('CMS_ACCESS_CMSMain', 'any', $member);
		}

You can also implement [custom permission codes](/topics/permissions).
For 3.1.0 stable, we aim to further simplify the permission definitions,
in order to reduce the boilerplate code required to get a model editable in the CMS.

Note: GridField is already relying on the permission checks performed
through the CMS controllers, providing a simple level of security.

### Other

 * `TableListField`, `ComplexTableField`, `TableField`, `HasOneComplexTableField`, `HasManyComplexTableField` and `ManyManyComplexTableField` have been removed from the core and placed into a module called "legacytablefields" located at https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/legacytablefields
 * `prototype.js` and `behaviour.js` have been removed from the core, they are no longer used. If you have custom code relying on these two libraries, please update your code to include the files yourself
 * `Object::has_extension()` and `Object::add_extension()` deprecated in favour of using late static binding, please use `{class}::has_extension()` and `{class}::add_extension()` instead, where {class} is the class name of your DataObject class.
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaKeywords` since they are irrelevant in terms of SEO ([seomoz article](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/keywords-meta-tag-in-web-search/)) and general page informancy
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaTitle` as a means to customize the window title, use `SiteTree.Title` instead
 * Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
 * Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
   `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
 * Removed `Member_ProfileForm`, use `CMSProfileController` instead
 * `SiteTree::$nested_urls` enabled by default. To disable, call `SiteTree::disable_nested_urls()`.
 * Removed CMS permission checks from `File->canEdit()` and `File->canDelete()`. If you have unsecured controllers relying on these permissions, please override them through a `DataExtension`.
 * Moved email bounce handling to new ["emailbouncehandler" module](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-emailbouncehandler),
   including `Email_BounceHandler` and `Email_BounceRecord` classes,
   as well as the `Member->Bounced` property. 
 * Deprecated global email methods `htmlEmail()` and `plaintextEmail`, as well as various email helper methods like `encodeMultipart()`. Use the `Email` API, or the `Mailer` class where applicable.
 * Removed non-functional `$inlineImages` option for sending emails 
 * Removed support for keyed arrays in `SelectionGroup`, use new `SelectionGroup_Item` object
   to populate the list instead (see [API docs](api:SelectionGroup)).
 * `FormField->setDescription()` now renders in a `<span class="description">` by default, rather than a `title` attribute * Removed `Form->Name()`: Use getName()
 * Removed `FormField->setContainerFieldSet()`: Use setContainerFieldList()
 * Removed `FormField->rootFieldSet()`: Use rootFieldList()
 * Removed `Group::map()`: Use DataList::("Group")->map()
 * Removed `Member->generateAutologinHash()`: Tokens are no longer saved directly into the database in plaintext. Use the return value of the Member::generateAutologinTokenAndHash to get the token
 * Removed `Member->sendInfo()`: use Member_ChangePasswordEmail or Member_ForgotPasswordEmail directly
 * Removed `SQLMap::map()`: Use DataList::("Member")->map()
 * Removed `SQLMap::mapInGroups()`: Use Member::map_in_groups()
 * Removed `PasswordEncryptor::register()/unregister()`: Use config system instead
 * Methods on DataList and ArrayList that used to both modify the existing list & return a new version now just return a new version. Make sure you change statements like `$list->filter(...)` to $`list = $list->filter(...)` for these methods:
   - `ArrayList#reverse`
   - `ArrayList#sort`
   - `ArrayList#filter`
   - `ArrayList#exclude`
   - `DataList#where`
   - `DataList#limit`
   - `DataList#sort`
   - `DataList#addFilter`
   - `DataList#applyFilterContext`
   - `DataList#innerJoin`
   - `DataList#leftJoin`
   - `DataList#find`
   - `DataList#byIDs`
   - `DataList#reverse`
 * `DataList#dataQuery` has been changed to return a clone of the query, and so can't be used to modify the list's query directly. Use `DataList#alterDataQuery` instead to modify dataQuery in a safe manner.
