# 3.1.0 (unreleased)

## Overview ##

## Upgrading

 * `TableListField`, `ComplexTableField`, `TableField`, `HasOneComplexTableField`, `HasManyComplexTableField` and `ManyManyComplexTableField` have been removed from the core and placed into a module called "legacytablefields" located at https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/legacytablefields
 * `prototype.js` and `behaviour.js` have been removed from the core, they are no longer used. If you have custom code relying on these two libraries, please update your code to include the files yourself
 * `Object::has_extension()` and `Object::add_extension()` deprecated in favour of using late static binding, please use `{class}::has_extension()` and `{class}::add_extension()` instead, where {class} is the class name of your DataObject class.
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaTitle` and `SiteTree.MetaKeywords` since they are irrelevant in terms of SEO ([1](http://www.seomoz.org/learn-seo/title-tag), [2](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/keywords-meta-tag-in-web-search/)) and general page informancy
 * Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
 * Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
   `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
 * Removed `Member_ProfileForm`, use `CMSProfileController` instead
 * `SiteTree::$nested_urls` enabled by default. To disable, call `SiteTree::disable_nested_urls()`.
 * Removed CMS permission checks from `File->canEdit()` and `File->canDelete()`. If you have unsecured controllers relying on these permissions, please override them through a `DataExtension`.
