# 3.1.0 (unreleased)

## Overview ##

## Upgrading

### Optional Model Permission Checks for GridField and ModelAdmin

Checking `DataObject->can...()` permissions in `GridField` and `ModelAdmin`
is now implemented consistently.
Previously, some model permissions weren't checked, such as `canCreate()` on GridField's "add" button,
or `canEdit()` on GridField's detail form.
Both classes now default to NOT checking model permissions, and relying on
the controller-level permissions only (configured through `admin/security`).

Enable permission checks in ModelAdmin:

	:::php
	class MyAdmin extends ModelAdmin {
		// ...
		public static $check_model_permissions = true;
	}

Enable permission checks in GridField:

	:::php
	$myGridField = new GridField(...);
	$myGridField->setCheckModelPermissions(true);

Note that the default `DataObject` permissions default to requiring an administrator,
you can [override the model permissions](/reference/dataobject#permissions) for more granular control.

### Grouped CMS Buttons

The CMS buttons are now grouped, in order to hide minor actions by default and declutter the interface.
This required changing the form field structure from a simple `FieldList`
to a `FieldList` which contains a `CompositeField` for all "major actions",
and a `TabSet` with a single tab for all "minor actions".
If you have previously added, removed or altered built-in CMS actions in any way,
you'll need to adjust your code.

	:::php
	class MyPage extends Page {
		function getCMSActions() {
			$actions = parent::getCMSActions();

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (old)
			$actions->push(new FormAction('MyAction')); 

			// Inserting a new toplevel action (new)
			$actions->insertAfter(new FormAction('MyAction'), 'MajorActions');

			// Removing an action, both toplevel and nested (no change required)
			$actions->removeByName('action_unpublish'); 

			// Inserting a new minor action (new)
			$actions->addFieldToTab(
				'Root.ActionMenus.MoreOptions',
				new FormAction('MyMinorAction')
			);

			// Finding a toplevel action (no change required)
			$match = $actions->dataFieldByName('action_save');

			// Finding a nested action (new)
			$match = $actions->fieldByName('ActionMenus.MoreOptions')
				->fieldByName('action_MyMinorAction'); 

			return $actions;
		}
	}

### Other

 * `TableListField`, `ComplexTableField`, `TableField`, `HasOneComplexTableField`, `HasManyComplexTableField` and `ManyManyComplexTableField` have been removed from the core and placed into a module called "legacytablefields" located at https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/legacytablefields
 * `prototype.js` and `behaviour.js` have been removed from the core, they are no longer used. If you have custom code relying on these two libraries, please update your code to include the files yourself
 * `Object::has_extension()` and `Object::add_extension()` deprecated in favour of using late static binding, please use `{class}::has_extension()` and `{class}::add_extension()` instead, where {class} is the class name of your DataObject class.
 * Removed `SiteTree.MetaTitle` and `SiteTree.MetaKeywords` since they are irrelevant in terms of SEO ([1](http://www.seomoz.org/learn-seo/title-tag), [2](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/keywords-meta-tag-in-web-search/)) and general page informancy
 * Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
 * Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
   `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
 * Removed `Member_ProfileForm`, use `CMSProfileController` instead
 * `SiteTree::$nested_urls` enabled by default. To disable, call `SiteTree::disable_nested_urls()`.
 * Removed CMS permission checks from `File->canEdit()` and `File->canDelete()`. If you have unsecured controllers relying on these permissions, please override them through a `DataExtension`.
 * Moved email bounce handling to new ["emailbouncehandler" module](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-emailbouncehandler),
   including `Email_BounceHandler` and `Email_BounceRecord` classes,
   as well as the `Member->Bounced` property. 
 * Deprecated global email methods `htmlEmail()` and `plaintextEmail`, as well as various email helper methods like `encodeMultipart()`. Use the `Email` API, or the `Mailer` class where applicable.
 * Removed non-functional `$inlineImages` option for sending emails 
 * Removed support for keyed arrays in `SelectionGroup`, use new `SelectionGroup_Item` object
   to populate the list instead (see [API docs](api:SelectionGroup)).
 * `FormField->setDescription()` now renders in a `<span class="description">` by default, rather than a `title` attribute * Removed `Form->Name()`: Use getName()
 * Removed `FormField->setContainerFieldSet()`: Use setContainerFieldList()
 * Removed `FormField->rootFieldSet()`: Use rootFieldList()
 * Removed `Group::map()`: Use DataList::("Group")->map()
 * Removed `Member->generateAutologinHash()`: Tokens are no longer saved directly into the database in plaintext. Use the return value of the Member::generateAutologinTokenAndHash to get the token
 * Removed `Member->sendInfo()`: use Member_ChangePasswordEmail or Member_ForgotPasswordEmail directly
 * Removed `SQLMap::map()`: Use DataList::("Member")->map()
 * Removed `SQLMap::mapInGroups()`: Use Member::map_in_groups()
 * Removed `PasswordEncryptor::register()/unregister()`: Use config system instead
 * Methods on DataList and ArrayList that used to both modify the existing list & return a new version now just return a new version. Make sure you change statements like `$list->filter(...)` to $`list = $list->filter(...)` for these methods:
   - `ArrayList#reverse`
   - `ArrayList#sort`
   - `ArrayList#filter`
   - `ArrayList#exclude`
   - `DataList#where`
   - `DataList#limit`
   - `DataList#sort`
   - `DataList#addFilter`
   - `DataList#applyFilterContext`
   - `DataList#innerJoin`
   - `DataList#leftJoin`
   - `DataList#find`
   - `DataList#byIDs`
   - `DataList#reverse`
 * `DataList#dataQuery` has been changed to return a clone of the query, and so can't be used to modify the list's query directly. Use `DataList#alterDataQuery` instead to modify dataQuery in a safe manner.
