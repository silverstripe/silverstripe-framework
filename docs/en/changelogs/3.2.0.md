### DataObject::validate() method visibility changed to public

The visibility of `DataObject::validate()` has been changed from `protected` to `public`.

Any existing classes that currently set this as `protected` should be changed like in
this example:

	class MyDataClass extends DataObject {
		...
		public function validate() {
			...
		}
		...
	}
