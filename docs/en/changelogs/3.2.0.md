## Changelog

### DataObject::validate() method visibility changed to public

The visibility of `DataObject::validate()` has been changed from `protected` to `public`.

Any existing classes that currently set this as `protected` should be changed like in
this example:

	::php
	class MyDataClass extends DataObject {
		...
		public function validate() {
			...
		}
		...
	}

### UploadField "Select from files" shows files in all folders by default

In order to list files in a single folder by default (previous default behaviour), 
use `setDisplayFolderName()` with a folder path relative to `assets/`:

	UploadField::create('MyField')->setDisplayFolderName('Uploads');
