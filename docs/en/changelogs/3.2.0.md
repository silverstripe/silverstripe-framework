## Changelog

### DataObject::validate() method visibility changed to public

The visibility of `DataObject::validate()` has been changed from `protected` to `public`.

Any existing classes that currently set this as `protected` should be changed like in
this example:

	::php
	class MyDataClass extends DataObject {
		...
		public function validate() {
			...
		}
		...
	}

### UploadField "Select from files" shows files in all folders by default

In order to list files in a single folder by default (previous default behaviour), 
use `setDisplayFolderName()` with a folder path relative to `assets/`:

	UploadField::create('MyField')->setDisplayFolderName('Uploads');

### File.allowed_extensions restrictions

Certain file types such as swf, html, htm, xhtml and xml have been removed from the list
of allowable file uploads. If your application requires the ability to upload these,
you will need to append these to the `File.allowed_extensions` config as necessary.
Also if uploading other file types, it's necessary to ensure that `File.allowed_extensions`
includes that extension, as extensions passed to `[api:UploadField]` will be filtered against
this list.

### Removed format detection in i18n::$date_format and i18n::$time_format

Localized dates cause inconsistencies in client-side vs. server-side formatting
and validation, particularly in abbreviated month names. The default date
format has been changed to "yyyy-MM-dd" (e.g. 2014-12-31). 
New users will continue to have the option for a localized date
format in their profile (based on their chosen locale).
If you have existing users with `Member.DateFormat` set to a format
including "MMM" or "MMMM", consider deleting those formats to fall back to
the global (and more stable) default.
