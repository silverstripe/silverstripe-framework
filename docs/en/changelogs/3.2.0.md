## Changelog

### DataObject::validate() method visibility changed to public

The visibility of `DataObject::validate()` has been changed from `protected` to `public`.

Any existing classes that currently set this as `protected` should be changed like in
this example:

	::php
	class MyDataClass extends DataObject {
		...
		public function validate() {
			...
		}
		...
	}

### UploadField "Select from files" shows files in all folders by default

In order to list files in a single folder by default (previous default behaviour), 
use `setDisplayFolderName()` with a folder path relative to `assets/`:

	UploadField::create('MyField')->setDisplayFolderName('Uploads');

### Removed format detection in i18n::$date_format and i18n::$time_format

Localized dates cause inconsistencies in client-side vs. server-side formatting
and validation, particularly in abbreviated month names. The default date
format has been changed to "yyyy-MM-dd" (e.g. 2014-12-31). 
New users will continue to have the option for a localized date
format in their profile (based on their chosen locale).
If you have existing users with `Member.DateFormat` set to a format
including "MMM" or "MMMM", consider deleting those formats to fall back to
the global (and more stable) default.
