# 4.8.0 (Unreleased)

## Overview

- [Support for silverstripe/graphql v4](#graphql-v4)

## New features

### Support for silverstripe/graphql v4 {#graphql-v4}

The [silverstripe/graphql](http://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/issues) module
to drive various parts of the CMS UI, as well as building your own GraphQL APIs in Silverstripe projects.

The CMS currently ships with `silverstripe/graphql:^3`, which is stable but slow for larger schemas.
The module was rewritten from scratch with performance in mind
(see [goals](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/8824) and [pull request](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/pulls)).
The resulting`silverstripe/graphql:^4` release is currently in a alpha stage.
We encourage everyone to get started, read our new [GraphQL documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/), 
provide [feedback](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-graphql/issues) and help us stabilise the module.

In order to facilitate the new module release, most GraphQL helper classes to drive the CMS UI
have been marked as deprecated, and moved to `GraphQL/_legacy` folders within core modules.
The GraphQL schema under `admin/graphql` has been altered slightly to enable forwards compability,
with lower-camelcase field names, and a different filter argument structure.
In the unlikely case that you are relying on those classes or queries directly,
consider upgrading to `silverstripe/graphql:^4`.
Your own GraphQL schemas outside of `admin/graphql` should not be affected by the changes
if you choose to stay on `silverstripe/graphql:^3` for the time being.

We are planning to require the use of `silverstripe/graphql:^4` in a future CMS 4.x release.
