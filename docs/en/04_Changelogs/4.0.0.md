# 4.0.0

## Introduction

This version introduces many breaking changes, which in most projects can be managed through a combination
of automatic upgrade processes as well as manual code review. This changelogs described all API changes in detail.

[Read _Upgrading to SilverStripe 4_](/upgrading/) for a detailed step-by-step guide on upgrading your SilverStripe 3 project to SilverStripe 4.0

For users upgrading to 4.1.0 please see the specific [4.1.0 changelogs](4.1.0.md).

  

## Overview {#overview}

* Minimum version dependencies have increased; PHP 5.6 and Internet Explorer 11 (or other modern browser)
  are required.
* All code earlier marked as deprecated for 4.0 has now been removed (check our
  [deprecation process](/contributing/release_process))
* **4.1.0 only** Support for public webroot folder `public/` ([details](4.1.0#public-folder))
* All code has been migrated to follow the PSR-2 coding standard. Most significantly, all SilverStripe
 classes are now namespaced, and some have been renamed. This has major implications for
  arrangement of templates, as well as other references to classes via string literals or configuration.
  Automatic upgrading tools have been developed to cope with the bulk of these changes (see
  [upgrading notes](#upgrading)).
* Object class has been replaced with traits ([details](#object-replace)).
* Asset storage has been abstracted, and a new concept of `DBFile` references via database column references
  now exists in addition to references via the existing `File` dataobject. File security and protected files
  are now a core feature ([details](#asset-storage))
* A new front-end development process has been developed for the construction of javascript based components,
  prominently featuring ReactJS to develop highly functional CMS content areas. A new standard form schema
  API has been developed to allow back-end PHP constructed forms to scaffold themselves within ReactJS
  powered sections.
* CMS CSS has been re-developed using Bootstrap v4 as a base
  ([blog post](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/a-frameworks-framework-why-silverstripe-4-will-use-bootstrap/))
* Asset admin has been replaced with a purely ReactJS powered upgrade, and split out
  module called [asset-admin](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-asset-admin/).
* Versioning is now a much more powerful feature, with the addition of campaigns to allow batches of related
  or inter-dependent objects to be published as a single "changeset" ([details](#changeset)).
* Dependencies between versioned objects can be
  declared using the new ownership API, so that developers can ensure that relational consistency is
  maintained during publishing ([details](#ownership))
  This new system can be managed via the new "Campaigns" CMS section ([blog post](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/campaigns-in-silverstripe-4/))
* Template variable casting (e.g. `<h1>$Title</h1>`) is enforced by default, which will ensure safe HTML encode
  unless explicitly opted out ([details](#template-casting))
* Themes are now configured to cascade, where you can specify a list of themes, and have the template engine
  search programatically through a prioritised list when resolving template and CSS file paths.
* Removed module path constants (e.g. `FRAMEWORK_PATH`) and support for hardcoded file paths (e.g. `mysite/css/styles.css`) ([details](#module-paths))
* Replaced Zend_Translate with symfony/translation ([details](#i18n))
* Replaced `Zend_Cache` and the `Cache` API with a PSR-16 implementation (symfony/cache) ([details](#cache))
* `_ss_environment.php` files have been removed in favour of `.env` and "real" environment variables ([details](/upgrading/#env)).
* Behat support updated to v3 (
  [details](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-behat-extension))
* The `GDBackend` and `ImagickBackend` classes have been replaced by a unified `InterventionBackend` which uses the
  [intervention/image](https://github.com/intervention/image) library to power manipualations.
* Dependencies can managed via [recipe-plugin](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-plugin). See [recipe-core](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-core) and [recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms) as examples.
* Authentication has been upgraded to a modular approach using re-usable interfaces and easier to hook in to LoginHandlers ([details](#custom-authenticators)).
* Core modules are installed in the `vendor/` folder by default (other modules can opt-in, see [guide](/developer_guides/extending/how_tos/publish_a_module))
* Renamed constant for temp folder from `TEMP_FOLDER` to `TEMP_PATH` for naming consistency with other path variables and constants

## Upgrading Guide {#upgrading}

The below sections describe how to go about updating an existing site to be prepared for upgrade to 4.0.
Most of these upgrading tasks will involve manual code review, although in some cases there are
some automated processes that users can run.

### Composer dependency update {#deps}

As a first step, you need to update your composer dependencies.
The easiest way is to start with a new `composer.json` file
and gradually move over settings from your old one.
This way you don't get dependency conflicts with potentially incompatible modules.

Backup your existing `composer.json` and overwrite it with the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "myvendor/myproject",
  "require": {
    "silverstripe/recipe-cms": "^1.0"
  },
  "prefer-stable": true,
  "minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

This composer file uses the new [recipe](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-plugin) approach 
which bundles all core dependencies in a meta package. If you want more granular control over what gets installed, 
reading through the README documentation in the [recipe plugin repo](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-plugin) 
and also checking the `composer.json` files in [recipe-core](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-core) and 
[recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms).

Now run a `composer update`. This will remove all existing modules from your local codebase 
since we replaced your project's `composer.json`. Now you can move your modules back 
one by one, checking for compatible versions on [packagist.org](http://packagist.org).

Note: If you have issues with a pre-existing composer install you can force a clean re-install with the 
below commands:

```bash
rm -rf vendor/composer
rm composer.lock
composer update
```

For modules with stable releases, simply set your composer constraints to the new version
(with a [next significant release](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#next-significant-release-operators) operator).

```diff
{
  "require": {
-    "myvendor/compatible-module": "~2.0",
+    "myvendor/compatible-module": "~3.0",
  }
}
```

For modules with a compatible pre-release, use an explicit [stability constraints](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#stability-constraints).
This can be changed to a [next significant release](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md#next-significant-release-operators) operator
once the module is stable.

```diff
{
  "require": {
-    "myvendor/prerelease-module": "~2.0",
+    "myvendor/prerelease-module": "~3.0@dev",
  }
}
```

For modules that don't have a pre-release branch started, you should raise an issue on the repository asking for 4.0 
compatibility.
For now, you should attempt to continue the upgrade without the module and temporarily disable its functionality.


### Using the upgrader tool {#upgrader-tool}

We've developed [an upgrader tool](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader) which you can use to help 
with the upgrade process to SilverStripe 4. See the README documentation in the repository for more detailed 
instructions on how to use it.


### `index.php` and `.htaccess` rewrites {#index-php-rewrites}

The location of SilverStripe's "entry file" has changed. Your project and server environment will need
to adjust the path to this file from `framework/main.php` to `public/index.php`.
Use [`recipe-core` index.php](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-core) as a reference to ensure the contents of
your `index.php` file is correct.

If you are running Apache, adjust your `.htaccess` file. For other webservers,
please consult the [installation guides](getting_started/installation/).
Since 4.0, URL rewrite capabilities are required,
unless you use PHP's built-in webserver through [silverstripe/serve](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-serve).

The [upgrader tool](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/) has a task runner which
automates this process for you.

After installing, run the upgrader:

```
cd ~/my-project-root
upgrade-code doctor
```

This will ensure that your `.htaccess` and `index.php` are set to a reasonable default value
for a clean installation. If you have applied customisations to your `.htaccess`
file (e.g. a custom `main.php`, HTTP header configuration, deny file access),
you'll need to manually reapply these to the copied default file.

### Migrate File DataObject {#migrate-file}

Since the structure of `File` dataobjects has changed, a new task `MigrateFileTask`
has been added to assist in migration of legacy files (see [file migration documentation](/developer_guides/files/file_migration)).

```
$ ./vendor/bin/sake dev/tasks/MigrateFileTask
```

Any `File` in the database with an extension which is not in the `File.allowed_extensions` config will be considered 
invalid and deleted from the database during migration.

Any invalid file on the filesystem will not be deleted in the filesystem, but will no longer be recorded in the 
database, and should be cleaned up manually.

To disable deleting from the database, set the following config:

```yaml
SilverStripe\Assets\FileMigrationHelper:
  delete_invalid_files: false
```

### Get upgrade tips on your code {#inspect-hints}

While there's some code we can automatically rewrite, other uses of changed SilverStripe APIs aren't that obvious.
You can use our heuristics to get some hints on where you need to review code manually.
Hints will generally point to more detail about a specific upgrade in this guide.
This task should be run *after* `upgrade-code upgrade`.

```
~/.composer/vendor/bin/upgrade-code inspect ./mysite
```

These hints only cover a part of the upgrade work,
but can serve as a good indicator for where to start.

### Object class replaced by traits {#object-replace}

Object has been superseded by traits.

 - `Injectable`: Provides `MyClass::create()` and `MyClass::singleton()`
 - `Configurable`: Provides `MyClass::config()`
 - `Extensible`: Provides all methods related to extensions (E.g. add_extension()).
  
Upgrade subclass use


```diff
-class MyClass extends Object
-{
-}
+use SilverStripe\Core\Extensible;
+use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injectable;
+use SilverStripe\Core\Config\Configurable;
+class MyClass
+{
+    use Extensible;
+    use Injectable;
+    use Configurable;
+}
```


Upgrade references to $this->class

```diff
-$obj->class
+get_class($obj);

-$this->class;
+static::class;
```

Upgrade parse_class_spec()

```diff
-$spec = Object::parse_class_spec($spec);
+$spec = ClassInfo::parse_class_spec($spec);
```

Upgrade create_from_string()


```diff
-$obj = Object::create_from_string('Varchar(100)');
+$obj = Injector::inst()->create('Varchar(100)');
```

Upgrade extension use

```diff

-Object::add_extension('File', 'Versioned');
+File::add_extension(Versioned::class);
+DataObject::add_extension(File::class, Versioned::class); // alternate

-$has = Object::has_extension('File', 'Versioned');
+$has = File::has_extension(Versioned::class);
+$has = DataObject::has_extension(File::class, Versioned::class); // alternate

-$extensions = Object::get_extensions('File');
+$extensions = File::get_extensions();
+$extensions = DataObject::get_extensions(File::class); // alternate
```

### Rewrite literal table names {#literal-table-names}

In 3.x the class name of any DataObject matched the table name, but in 4.x all classes are namespaced, and it is
necessary to map between table and class for querying the database.

In order to ensure you are using the correct table for any class a new
[DataObjectSchema](api:SilverStripe\ORM\DataObjectSchema) service is available to manage these mappings
(see [Versioned documentation](/developer_guides/model/data_model_and_orm)).
For example, the below shows how you would update a query with a hard-coded table name:

```diff
public function countDuplicates($model, $fieldToCheck)
{
    $query = new SilverStripe\ORM\Queries\SQLSelect();
+    $table = SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject::getSchema()->tableForField($model, $field);
-    $query->setFrom("\"{$model}\"");
+    $query->setFrom("\"{$table}\"");
-    $query->setWhere(["\"{$model}\".\"{$field}\"" => $model->$fieldToCheck]);
+    $query->setWhere(["\"{$table}\".\"{$field}\"" => $model->$fieldToCheck]);
    return $query->count();
}
```

### Rewrite literal class names {#literal-class-names}

You'll need to update any strings that represent class names and make sure they're fully
qualified. In particular, relationship definitions such as `has_one` and `has_many` will need
to be updated to refer to fully qualified class names.

In configs and with literal PHP strings it is recommended to use the php `::class` constant,
as demonstrated below.

```diff
<?php
+ use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
+ use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
class MyClass extends DataObject 
{
    private static $has_one = [
-    'Author' => 'Member',
+    'Author' => Member::class,
    ];
}
```
 
In the context of YAML, the magic constant `::class` does not apply. Fully qualified class names must be hard coded.

```diff
-MyObject:
+My\Project\MyObject:
  property: value
```

### Controllers renamed {#controllers-renamed}

The convention for naming controllers is now `[MyPageType]Controller`, where it used to be `[MyPageType]_Controller`. This change was made to be more compatible with the PSR-2 standards.

You can still use, for example, `Page_Controller`, but you will get a deprecation notice. It is 
best to change it to `PageController` during your upgrade process. Keep in mind any modules or
other thirdparty code that extend `PageController` are likely to assume that class exists.

By default, a controller for a page type *must* reside in the same namespace as its page. To use different logic, override `SiteTree::getControllerName()`.

### Template locations and references {#template-locations}

Templates are now more strict about their locations.
Case is now also checked on case-sensitive filesystems.

Either include the folder in the template name (`renderWith('MyEmail.ss')` => `renderWith('emails/MyEmail.ss')`),
move the template into the correct directory, or both.

Core template locations have moved - if you're including or overriding these
(e.g. for `FormField` templates) please adjust to the new paths. The `forms` folder
no longer exists, and instead template locations will be placed in paths that match
the class namespace, `SilverStripe\Forms`.

When using the `<% include %>` template tag you can continue to leave out the `Includes` folder,
but this will search templates in the base folder if no Include can be found.

`<% include Sidebar %>` will match `Includes/Sidebar.ss`, but will also match `Sidebar.ss`
if the former is not present.

Please refer to our [template syntax](/developer_guides/templates/syntax) for details.

### Config settings should be set to `private static` {#private-static}

Class configuration defined as `static` properties need to be marked as `private` to take effect:

```diff
-public static $allowed_actions = [
+private static $allowed_actions = [
    'suggest'
];
```

### Module paths can't be hardcoded {#module-paths}

You should no longer rely on modules being placed in a deterministic folder (e.g. `/framework`),
and use getters on the [Module](api:SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\Module) object instead.
They expect a module composer name, followed by the module relative path, separated by a double colon. 
This prepares SilverStripe for moving modules out of the webroot at a later point.

Usage in templates:

```diff
-<img src="framework/images/image.png" />
+<img src="$ModulePath(silverstripe/framework)/images/image.png" />

-<% require css("framework/css/styles.css") %>
+<% require css("silverstripe/framework: css/styles.css") %>
```

Usage in Requirements:

```diff
-Requirements::css('framework/css/styles.css');
+Requirements::css('silverstripe/framework: css/styles.css');
```

Usage with custom logic:

```diff
+use SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\ModuleLoader;
+use SilverStripe\View\ThemeResourceLoader;
+use SilverStripe\View\SSViewer;

-$moduleFilePath = FRAMEWORK_DIR . '/MyFile.php';
+$moduleFilePath = ModuleLoader::getModule('silverstripe/framework')->getResource('MyFile.php')->getRelativePath();

-$baseFilePath = BASE_PATH . '/composer.json';
+$baseFilePath = Director::baseFolder() . '/composer.json';
 
-$mysiteFilePath = 'mysite/css/styles.css';
+$mysiteFilePath = ModuleLoader::getModule('mysite')->getResource('css/styles.css')->getRelativePath();

-$themesFilePath = SSViewer::get_theme_folder() . '/css/styles.css';
+$themes = SSViewer::get_themes();
+$themesFilePath = ThemeResourceLoader::inst()->findThemedResource('css/styles.css', $themes);

-$themeFolderPath = THEMES_DIR . '/simple';
+$themeFolderPath = ThemeResourceLoader::inst()->getPath('simple');
```

Usage for Page and ModelAdmin:

```php
class ListingPage extends \Page
{
    private static $icon = 'mycompany/silverstripe-mymodule: client/images/sitetree_icon.png';
}
```

```php
class MyCustomModelAdmin extends \SilverStripe\Admin\ModelAdmin
{
    private static $menu_icon = 'mycompany/silverstripe-mymodule: client/images/modeladmin_icon.png';
}
```

To ensure consistency, we've also deprecated support for path constants:

 * Deprecated `FRAMEWORK_DIR` and `FRAMEWORK_PATH`
 * Deprecated `FRAMEWORK_ADMIN_DIR` and `FRAMEWORK_ADMIN_PATH`
 * Deprecated `FRAMEWORK_ADMIN_THIRDPARTY_DIR` and `FRAMEWORK_ADMIN_THIRDPARTY_PATH`
 * Deprecated `THIRDPARTY_DIR` and `THIRDPARTY_PATH`
 * Deprecated `CMS_DIR` and `CMS_PATH`
 * Deprecated `THEMES_DIR` and `THEMES_PATH`
 * Deprecated `MODULES_PATH` and `MODULES_DIR`
 
### Adapt tooling to modules in vendor folder {#vendor-folder}

SilverStripe modules can now be installed like any other composer package: In the `vendor/` folder
instead of the webroot. Modules need to opt in to this behaviour after they've ensured
that no hardcoded path references exist (see "Upgrade module paths in file references").

All core modules have been moved over already:

```diff
-framework/
+vendor/silverstripe/framework/
-cms/
+vendor/silverstripe/cms/
...
```

Since the `vendor/` folder isn't publicly accessible, modules need to declare
which files need to be exposed via the new [vendor-plugin](https://github.com/silverstripe/vendor-plugin)
(e.g. images or CSS/JS files). These files will be either symlinked or copied into a new `resources/`
folder automatically on `composer install`.

If your deployment process relies on `composer install` on the production environment,
and this environment supports symlinks, you don't need to change anything.
If you deploy release archives or upload code via FTP,
either ensure those archives can correctly extract symlinks,
or explicitly switch to the "copy" mode to avoid symlinks. 

At this point, you should consider using a [public/ folder as the webroot](4.1.0#public-folder),
which was introduced in the newer [4.1.0](4.1.0) release.
The same [vendor-plugin](https://github.com/silverstripe/vendor-plugin) mechanism
should be used to expose public files in your themes and project folders.

### SS_Log replaced with PSR-3 logging {#psr3-logging}

One of the great changes that comes with SilverStripe 4 is the introduction of 
[PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) compatible logger interfaces. This 
means we can use thirdparty services like Monolog. `SS_Log` has been replaced
with a logger which can be accessed using the LoggerInterface::class service.

For instance, code which logs errors should be upgraded as below:

```diff
-SS_Log::log('My error message', SS_Log::ERR);
+use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
+use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector;
+Injector::inst()->get(LoggerInterface::class)->error('My error message');
```

If necessary, you may need to customise either the default logging handler, or
one of the error formatters. For example, if running unit tests you may want to
suppress errors. You can temporarily disable logging by setting a `NullHandler`

```yml
---
Name: custom-dev-logging
After: dev-logging
Only:
  environment: dev
---
# Replace default handler with null
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  Monolog\Handler\HandlerInterface: Monolog\Handler\NullHandler
```

Alternatively you can customise one or both of the below services:
  - `Monolog\Formatter\FormatterInterface.detailed` service, which is used for displaying
  detailed error messages useful for developers.
  - `Monolog\Formatter\FormatterInterface.friendly` service, which is used to display "error"
  page content to visitors of the site who encounter errors.

For example, a custom error page generator could be added as below:

```yml
---
Name: custom-errorpage
After:
  - '#loggingformatters'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  Monolog\Formatter\FormatterInterface.friendly:
    class: WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\Logging\ErrorPageFormatter
```

`WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\Logging\ErrorPageFormatter` should be a class that
implements the `Monolog\Formatter\FormatterInterface` interface.

### Upgrade `mysite/_config.php` {#config-php}

The global `$project` is deprecated in favour of the configuration setting
`SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\ModuleManifest.project`.

Changes to `mysite/_config.php`:

```diff
<?php
-global $project;
-$project = 'mysite';
-include 'conf/ConfigureFromEnv.php';
```

And also add to `mysite/_config/mysite.yml`:

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Manifest\ModuleManifest:
  project: mysite
```

### Session object removes static methods {#session}

Session object is no longer statically accessible via `Session::inst()`. Instead, Session
is a member of the current request.

```diff
public function httpSubmission($data, $form, $request)
{
-    Session::set('loggedIn', null);
+    $request->getSession()->set('loggedIn', null);
}
```


In some places it may still be necessary to access the session object where no request is available.
In rare cases it is still possible to access the request of the current controller via
`Controller::curr()->getRequest()` to gain access to the current session.

### Extensions are now singletons {#extensions-singletons}

Extensions are now all singletons, meaning that state stored as protected vars
within extensions are now shared across all object instances that use this extension.

As a result, you must take care that all protected vars are either refactored to be stored against
the owner object, or are keyed in a fashion distinct to the parent.

```diff
class MyExtension extends Extension {
    public function getContent() {
-        if (!$this->contentCache) {
-            $this->contentCache = $this->generateContent();
-        }
-        return $this->contentCache;
+        $contentCache = $this->owner->getField('contentCache');
+        if (!$contentCache) {
+            $contentCache = $this->generateContent();
+            $this->owner->setField('contentCache', $contentCache);
+        }
+        return $contentCache;
    }
}
```

When using extensions with distinct constructor arguments it's advisable to
use `yml` to register those constructor arguments and use a service name or alias in
`private static $extensions`. Please review the default service definitions below:

```yaml
---
Name: versionedextension
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  # Versioning only
  SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned.versioned:
    class: SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned
    constructor:
      mode: Versioned
  # Staging and Versioning
  SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned.stagedversioned:
    class: SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned
    constructor:
      mode: StagedVersioned
  # Default is alias for .stagedversioned
  SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned: '%$SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned.stagedversioned'
```

Upgrade your extension references:

```diff
class MyClass extends DataObject {
    private static $extensions = [
-        Versioned::class . '(Versioned)',
+        Versioned::class . '.versioned',
    ];
}
```

### Javascript files in framework/admin {#js-in-framework}

Most JavaScript files in `framework/javascript` have been removed,
and are bundled through [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) into a combined file instead.
If you have referenced these files elsewhere, please consider
running the ES6 source files in `vendor/silverstripe/admin/client/src/legacy`
through your own transpiling and bundle process.

This also includes JavaScript i18n support, and the removal of the `i18n::js_i18n`
configuration option used in `Requirements::add_i18n_javascript()`.

The CMS UI is moving away from `Requirements::combine_files()` in favour of Webpack.
This method is being considered for deprecation in future versions.

All JavaScript thirdparty dependencies have either been moved to NPM (see `package.json`),
or moved into the `framework/admin/thirdparty` folder. If you are hotlinking to any
of these files, please consider packaging your own versions in your projects and modules.
For CMS modules, you can also use many library globals which the core bundles already expose
(see [Build Tooling](/contributing/build_tooling)).

One commonly linked thirdparty dependency is `jquery.js` bundled with SilverStripe:

```
framework/thirdparty/jquery/jquery.js => framework/admin/thirdparty/jquery/jquery.js
```

If you have customised the CMS UI (via JavaScript or CSS), please read our guide to
[customise the admin interface](/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/).

### Explicit text casting on template variables {#template-casting}

Now whenever a `$Variable` is used in a template, regardless of whether any casts or methods are
suffixed to the reference, it will be cast to either an explicit DBField for that field, or
the value declared by the `default_cast` on the parent object.

The default value of `default_cast` is `Text`, meaning that now many cases where a field was
left un-uncoded, this will now be safely encoded via `Convert::raw2xml`. In cases where
un-cast fields were used to place raw HTML into templates, this will now encode this until
explicitly cast for that field.

You can resolve this in your model by adding an explicit cast to HTML for those fields.

```diff
use SilverStripe\View\ViewableData;
use SilverStripe\Core\Convert;

class MyObject extends ViewableData
{
+    private static $casting = [
+        'SomeHTML' => 'HTMLText'
+    ];

    public function getSomeHTML
    {
-        $title = Convert::raw2xml($this->Title);
+        $title = Convert::raw2xml($this->Title);
        return "<h1>{$title}</h1>";
    }
}
```

If you need to encode a field (such as `HTMLText`) for use in HTML attributes, use `.ATT`
instead, or if used in an actual XML file use `.CDATA` (see [template casting](/developer_guides/templates/casting)).

### Replace UploadField with injected service {#uploadfield}

This field has been superceded by a new class provided by the
[asset-admin](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-asset-admin) module, which provides a more
streamlined simpler mechanism for uploading `File` dataobjects.

A helper service `FileHandleField` is provided to assist with dependency injection. Where the asset-admin
module is not installed this service will fall back to the `FileField` class instead.
Usages of `UploadField` will need to be upgraded as below.

```diff
use SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList;
-use SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Forms\UploadField;
+use SilverStripe\Forms\FileHandleField;
+use SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyClass extends DataObject
{
    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        return new FieldList(
-            new UploadField('Files')
+            Injector::inst()->create(FileHandleField::class, 'Files')
        );
    }
}
```

### i18n placeholders, plurals and i18nEntityProvider {#i18n}

In many cases, localisation strings which worked in 3.x will continue to work in 4.0, however certain patterns
have been deprecated and will be removed in 5.0. These include:

 - `_t()` calls with sprintf-style placeholders (`%s`). Replace with named placeholders instead.
 - `_t()` calls with non-associative injection arguments. Please use an associative array for all arguments.
 - `_t()` calls which do not include a default value will now raise a warning. This can be disabled by setting
   the `i18n.missing_default_warning` config to false.
 
If you attempt to use non-associative injection arguments with named placeholders, the result will
now trigger an exception.

Implementors of `i18nEntityProvider` should note that the return type for `provideI18nEntities()` has changed as well.
The non-associative array return type is deprecated. If returning a default string for a module
other than itself, it should return an array with the `default` and `module` keys respectively.

Full locale-rule respecting localisation for plural forms is now supported. The default
key for an object plural form is `<Namespaced\ClassName>.PLURALS`, and follows CLDR array form for each
pluralisation. See [the CLDR chart](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
for reference.

The below demonstrates how you can provide new localisation strings for an object,
including both plurals and cross-module localisations.


```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyObject extends DataObject, implements i18nEntityProvider
{
    public function provideI18nEntities()
    {
        return [
            'MyObject.SINGULAR_NAME' => 'object',
            'MyObject.PLURAL_NAME' => 'objects',
            'MyObject.PLURALS' => [
                'one' => 'An object',
                'other' => '{count} objects',
            ],
            'AnotherSection.DESCRIPTION' => [
                'default' => 'This is the description for this section',
                'module' => 'extendedmodule',
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```


In YML format this will be expressed as the below:

`mymodule/lang/en.yml`:


```yml
en:
  MyObject:
    SINGULAR_NAME: 'object'
    PLURAL_NAME: 'objects'
    PLURALS:
      one: 'An object',
      other: '{count} objects'
```

`extendedmodule/lang/en.yml`:


```yml
en:
  AnotherSection:
    DESCRIPTION: 'This is the description for this section'
```


Usage of these pluralised strings is through the existing `_t()` method,
and require a `|` pipe-delimeter with a `{count}` argument.


```php
public function pluralise($count)
{
    return _t('MyObject.PLURALS', 'An object|{count} objects', [ 'count' => $count ]);
}
```

In templates this can also be invoked as below:


```ss
<%t MyObject.PLURALS 'An item|{count} items' count=$Count %>
```

### Removed Member.DateFormat and Member.TimeFormat database settings {#member-date-time-fields}

We're using [native HTML5 date and time pickers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)
in `DateField` and `TimeField` now ([discussion](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/issues/6626)),
where the browser localises the output based on the browser/system preferences.
In this context it no longer makes sense to give users control over their own
date and time formats in their CMS profile. 
Consequently, we've also removed `MemberDatetimeOptionsetField`.
 
`Member->getDateFormat()` and `Member->getTimeFormat()` still exist, and default to
the [IntlDateFormatter defaults](http://php.net/manual/en/class.intldateformatter.php) for the selected locale.


### New asset storage mechanism {#asset-storage}

File system has been abstracted into an abstract interface. By default, the out of the box filesystem
uses [Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/) with a local storage mechanism (under the assets directory).

Because the filesystem now uses the sha1 of file contents in order to version multiple versions under the same
filename, the default storage paths in 4.0 will not be the same as in 3.

In order to retain existing file paths in line with framework version 3 you should set the
`\SilverStripe\Filesystem\Flysystem\FlysystemAssetStore.legacy_paths` config to true.
Note that this will not allow you to utilise certain file versioning features in 4.0.


```yml
SilverStripe\Filesystem\Flysystem\FlysystemAssetStore:
  legacy_paths: true
```


See our ["File Management" guide](/developer_guides/files/file_management) for more information.

Depending on your server configuration, it may also be necessary to adjust your assets folder 
permissions. Please see the [common installation problems](/getting_started/installation/common_problems)
guide for configuration instruction.

### Image handling {#image-handling}

As all image-specific manipulations has been refactored from `Image` into an `ImageManipulations` trait, which
is applied to both `File` and `DBFile`. These both implement a common interface `AssetContainer`, which
has the `getIsImage()` method. In some cases, it may be preferable to invoke this method to detect
if the asset is an image or not, rather than checking the subclass, as the asset may also be a `DBFile` with
an image filter applied, rather than an instance of the `Image` dataobject.

In addition, a new file category `image/supported` has been added, which is a subset of the `image` category.
This is the subset of all image types which may be assigned to the [`Image`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\Image) 
dataobject, and may have manipulations applied to it. This should be used as the file type restriction on any 
[`UploadField`](api:SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Forms\UploadField) which is intended to upload images for manipulation.

```diff
-if($file instanceof Image) {
-    $upload = new UploadField();
-    $upload->setAllowedFileCategories('image');
-}
+if ($file->getIsImage()) {
+    $upload = new UploadField(); // see higher about using FileHandleField instead
+    $upload->setAllowedFileCategories('image/supported');
+}
```

In cases where image-only assets may be assigned to relationships then your datamodel should specify explicitly
an `Image` datatype, or refer to `DBFile('image/supported')`.

```php
use SilverStripe\Assets\Image;
class MyObject extends SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject
{
    private static $has_one = [
        "ImageObject" => Image::class
    ];
    private static $db = [
        "ImageField" => "DBFile('image/supported')"
    ];
}
```

### Writing to `File` dataobjects or the assets folder {#write-file-dataobject}

In the past all that was necessary to write a `File` DataObject to the database was to ensure a physical file
existed in the assets folder, and that the Filename of the DataObject was set to the same location.

Since the storage of physical files is no longer a standard location, it's necessary to delegate the writing of such
files to the asset persistence layer. As a wrapper for an individual file, you can use any of the `setFrom*`
methods to assign content from a local (e.g. temporary) file, a stream, or a string of content.
You would need to upgrade your code as below.

```diff
-function importTempFile($tmp)
-{
-    copy($tmp, ASSETS_PATH . '/imported/' . basename($tmp));
-    $file = new File();
-    $file->setFilename('assets/imported/'.basename($tmp));
-    $file->write();
-}
+public function importTempFile($tmp)
+{
+    Versioned::reading_stage('Stage');
+    $file = new File();
+    $file->setFromLocalFile($tmp, 'imported/' . basename($tmp));
+    $file->write();
+    $file->doPublish();
+}
```

Note that 'assets' is no longer present in the new code, and the path beneath what was once assets is now
used to generate the 'filename' value. This is because there is no longer an assumption that files are
stored in the assets folder.

There are other important considerations in working with File dataobjects which differ from legacy:

* File synchronisation is no longer automatic. This is due to the fact that there is no longer a 1-to-1 relationship
  between physical files and File DataObjects.
* Folder DataObjects are now purely logical DataObjects, and perform no actual filesystem folder creation on write.
* All Files are versioned, which means that by default, new File records will not be visibile
  to the public site. You will need to make sure to invoke `->doPublish()` on any File DataObject
  you wish visitors to be able to see.

You can disable File versioning by adding the following to your `_config.php`

```php
SilverStripe\Assets\File::remove_extension('Versioned');
```

### Custom image manipulations {#image-manipulations}

As file storage and handling has been refactored into the abstract interface, many other components which were
once specific to Image.php have now been moved into a shared `ImageManipulation` trait. Manipulations of file content,
which are used to generate what are now called "variants" of assets, is now a generic api available to both `File`
and `DBFile` classes through this trait.

Custom manipulations, applied via extensions, must be modified to use the new API.
For instance, code which sizes images to a fixed width should be updated as below:

Before:

```php
// in MyImageExtension.php
class MyImageExtension extends SilverStripe\ORM\DataExtension
{
    public function GalleryThumbnail($height)
    {
        return $this->getFormattedImage('GalleryThumbnail', $height);
    }

    public function generateGalleryThumbnail(Image_Backend $backend, $height)
    {
        return $backend->paddedResize(300, $height);
    }
}

// in _config.php
SilverStripe\Assets\Image::add_extension('MyImageExtension');
```

Now image manipulations are implemented with a single method via a callback generator:

```php
use SilverStripe\Assets\File;

// in MyImageExtension.php
class MyImageExtension extends SilverStripe\Core\Extension
{
    public function GalleryThumbnail($height)
    {
        // Generates the manipulation key
        $variant = $this->owner->variantName(__FUNCTION__, $height);

        // Instruct the backend to search for an existing variant with this key,
        // and include a callback used to generate this image if it doesn't exist
        return $this->owner->manipulateImage($variant, function (Image_Backend $backend) use ($height) {
            return $backend->paddedResize(300, $height);
        });
    }
}

// in _config.php
File::add_extension('MyImageExtension');
\SilverStripe\Filesystem\Storage\DBFile::add_extension('MyImageExtension');
```

There are a few differences in this new API:

* The extension is no longer specific to DataObjects, so it uses the generic `Extension` class instead of `DataExtension`
* This extension is added to both `DBFile` and `File`, or order to make this manipulation available to non-dataobject
  file references as well, but it could be applied to either independently.
* A helper method `variantName` is invoked in order to help generate a unique variant key. Custom code may use another
  generation mechanism.
* Non-image files may also have manipulations, however the specific `manipulateImage` should not be used in this case.
  A generic `manipulate` method may be used, although the callback for this method both is given, and should return,
  an `AssetStore` instance and file tuple (Filename, Hash, and Variant) rather than an Image_Backend.

### Customising file edit form fields {#customising-file-editform}

In 3.x, customisation of the edit form for files and images could be done using the conventional
`updateCMSFields(FieldList $fields)` hook. In 4.x, this method no longer has any influence
on the file edit form that gets rendered in asset-admin. Instead, create an extension for
`FileFormFactory` and use the `updateFormFields(FieldList $fields)` hook.

In this example, we'll add a `description` field to the `File` object and give it an editable
field in the CMS.

*app/_config/app.yml*
```yml
SilverStripe\Assets\File:
  extensions:
    - MyProject\MyFileExtension
SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Forms\FileFormFactory:
  extensions:
    - MyProject\MyFormFactoryExtension
```

*app/src/MyFileExtension.php*
```php
namespace MyProject;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataExtension;

class MyFileExtension extends DataExtension
{
    private static $db = [
        'Description' => 'Text',
    ];
}
```

*app/src/MyFormFactoryExtension.php*
```php
namespace MyProject;

use SilverStripe\Core\Extension;
use SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList;
use SilverStripe\Forms\TextareaField;

class MyFormFactoryExtension extends Extension
{
    public function updateFormFields(FieldList $fields)
    {
        $fields->insertAfter(
            'Title',
            TextareaField::create('Description', 'Description')
        );
    }
}
```

### File or Image shortcode handler {#file-shortcode}

The `handle_shortcode` methods have been removed from the core File and Image classes
and moved to separate classes in their own respective namespace.
`Image` and `File` do not implement the `ShortcodeHandler` interface anymore.
The shortcode handler for `File` has been moved to
`SilverStripe\Assets\ShortcodesFileShortcodeProvider` and
the Image handler has been moved to `SilverStripe\Assets\Shortcodes\ImageShortcodeProvider`

Example of changed shortcode handling:

```diff
+use SilverStripe\Assets\Shortcodes\FileShortcodeProvider;
class MyShortcodeUser extends Object 
{
    private $content;

    public function Content($arguments, $parser, $shortcode) 
    {
-        return File::handle_shortcode($arguments, $this->content, $parser, $shortcode);
+        return FileShortcodeProvider::handle_shortcode($arguments, $this->content, $parser, $shortcode);
    }
}
```

### Composite db fields {#compositedbfield}

The `CompositeDBField` interface has been replaced with an abstract class, `DBComposite`. In many cases, custom code
that handled saving of content into composite fields can be removed, as it is now handled by the base class.

The below describes the minimum amount of effort required to implement a composite DB field.

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBComposite;

class MyAddressField extends DBComposite
{
    private static $composite_db = [
        'Street' => 'Varchar(200)',
        'Suburb' => 'Varchar(100)',
        'City' => 'Varchar(100)',
        'Country' => 'Varchar(100)'
    ];

    public function scaffoldFormField($title = null, $params = null)
    {
        new SilverStripe\Forms\TextField($this->getName(), $title);
    }
}
```

### Removed `DataObject::database_fields` or `DataObject::db` {#dataobject-db-database-fields}

The methods `DataObject::database_fields()`, `DataObject::custom_database_fields()` and `DataObject::db()` have
been removed.

Instead, to get all database fields for a dataobject, including base fields (such as ID, ClassName, Created, and LastEdited), use `DataObject::getSchema()->databaseFields($className, $aggregate = true)`.
To omit the base fields, pass a value of `false`  as the `$aggregate` parameter, e.g. `DataObject::getSchema()->databaseFields(Member::class, false)`.

Composite database fields are omitted from the `databaseFields()` method. To get those, use `DataObject::getSchema()->compositeFields($className, $aggregate = true)`.


### Rewrite SQLQuery to more specific classes {#sqlquery}

Instead of `SQLQuery`, you should now use `SQLSelect`, `SQLUpdate`, `SQLInsert`
or `SQLDelete` - check the [3.2.0](3.2.0#sqlquery) upgrading notes for details.

Example:

```diff
-function augmentSQL(SQLQuery &$query, DataQuery &$dataQuery = null)
+public function augmentSQL(SQLSelect $query, DataQuery $dataQuery = null)
{
    if(!preg_match('/MyField/', implode(' ', $query->getWhere()))) {
-        $query->addWhere('"MyField" = \'foo\'');
+        $query->addWhere(['"MyField"' => 'foo']);
    }
}
```

### Upgrade BuildTask classes {#buildtask-segment}

Similarly to the `$table_name` configuration property for DataObjects, you should define a `private static $segment` for `BuildTask`
instances to ensure that you can still run your task via `sake dev/tasks/MyTask`. Without defining it, the default
will be a fully-qualified class name like `sake dev/tasks/Me-MyModule-Tasks-MyTask`. This can also be configured in YAML.

```php
use SilverStripe\Dev\BuildTask;

class MyTask extends BuildTask
{
    private static $segment = 'MyTask';
}
```

### Moved ErrorPage into a new module {#errorpage}

**NOTE**: This is included automatically if you switch to using the `recipe-cms` module.

ErrorPage has been moved to a separate [silverstripe/errorpage module](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/silverstripe/errorpage)
to allow for alternative approaches to managing error responses.
The module is installed by default on new projects, but needs to be added to existing projects
to preserve functionality on the existing "Page not found" and "Server error" pages in the CMS.

    composer require silverstripe/errorpage

Alternatively you can implement your own `onBeforeHTTPError()` handling to present custom errors.
By default, SilverStripe will display a plaintext "not found" message when the module isn't installed.
Check the [module upgrading guide](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/silverstripe/errorpage)
for more configuration API changes on the `ErrorPage` class.

### Server configuration files for assets {#assets-server-config}

Server configuration files for `/assets` are no longer static, and are regenerated via a set of
standard SilverStripe templates on flush. These templates include:

 * `Assets_HTAccess.ss`: Template for public permissions on the Apache server.
 * `Assets_WebConfig.ss`: Template for public permissions on the IIS server.
 * `Protected_HTAccess.ss`: Template for the protected store on the Apache server (should deny all requests).
 * `Protected_WebConfig.ss`: Template for the protected store on the IIS server (should deny all requests).

You will need to make sure that these files are writable via the web server, and that any necessary
configuration customisation is done via overriding these templates.

Depending on your server configuration, it may also be necessary to adjust your assets folder 
permissions. Please see the [common installation problems](/getting_started/installation/common_problems)
guide for configuration instruction.

If upgrading from an existing installation, make sure to invoke `?flush=all` at least once.

See our ["File Security" guide](/developer_guides/files/file_security) for more information.

### TinyMCE v4 {#tinymce}

Please see the [TinyMCE upgrading guide](http://archive.tinymce.com/wiki.php/Tutorial:Migration_guide_from_3.x)
to assist with upgrades to customisations to TinyMCE v3.

In Framework 4.0 the user interface for TinyMCE has been trimmed down considerably, with certain toolbar
buttons removed from the default cms configuration:

 * Strikethrough
 * Styles dropdown
 * Block quotes
 * Horizontal Rule
 * Undo / Redo
 * Cut / Paste as word
 * Select all
 * Fullscreen

However, these function may be enabled on a case by case basis through modification of the default TinyMCE config,
or by creating custom configurations (check [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tinymce.com/docs/configure/)).

The optional `ss_macron` plugin for inserting Māori diacritical marks
has been removed from core. You can configure the built-in `charmap` plugin instead:

```php
$editor = SilverStripe\Forms\HTMLEditor\HtmlEditorConfig::get('cms');
$editor->enablePlugins('charmap');
$editor->addButtonsToLine(1, 'charmap');
$editor->setOption('charmap_append', [
    ['256','A - macron'],
    ['274','E - macron'],
    ['298','I - macron'],
    ['332','O - macron'],
    ['362','U - macron'],
    ['257','a - macron'],
    ['275','e - macron'],
    ['299','i - macron'],
    ['333','o - macron'],
    ['363','u - macron']
]);
```

### DataObjects with the `Versioned` extension {#dataobject-versioned}

In most cases, versioned models with the default versioning parameters will not need to be changed. However,
there are now additional restrictions on the use of custom stage names.

Rather than declaring the list of stages a model has, the constructor for `Versioned` will take a single mode
parameter, which declares whether or not the model is versioned and has a draft and live stage, or alternatively
if it only has versioning without staging.

Each form of this extension is registered under the appropriate service identifier, which you should use in your
model as below:

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\ORM\Versioning\Versioned;

/**
 * This model has staging and versioning. Stages will be "Stage" and "Live"
 */
class MyStagedModel extends SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject
{
    private static $extensions = [
        Versioned::class . '.stagedversioned',
    ];
}

/**
 * This model has versioning only, and will not has a draft or live stage, nor be affected by the current stage.
 */
class MyVersionedModel extends DataObject
{
    private static $extensions = [
        Versioned::class . '.versioned',
    ];
}
```

Additionally, the following api methods have been added:

 * `Versioned::publishRecursive` Publishes this object, and all owned objects
 * `Versioned::publishSingle` Publishes this object, but not owned objects
 * `Versioned::copyVersionToStage` Replaces the old `publish` method.

These methods are deprecated:

 * `Versioned::publish` Replaced by `Versioned::copyVersionToStage`
 * `Versioned::doPublish` Replaced by `Versioned::publishRecursive`

### New Ownership API {#ownership}

In order to support the recursive publishing of dataobjects, a new API has been developed to allow
developers to declare dependencies between versioned objects.

```php
private static $owns = [
    'Banners', // This page depends on banners, declared as a separate 'has_many'
    'FooterImage', // This page depends on the footer image, declared as a separate 'has_one'
];
```

This is done to ensure that the published state of linked components are consistent with their "owner".
Without the concept of ownership, these linked components could be implicitly exposed on the frontend,
which may not align with the intent of the content author.

For instance, on a products page which has a list of products, the products should not be published unless
the products page is, too. The ownership API solves this by allowing you to declare a two-way relationship
between objects, typically, but not necessarily, linked by a database relationship
(`has_many`, `many_many`, etc.).

```php
use SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class ProductPage extends Page 
{
    private static $has_many = [
        'Products' => Product::class
    ];
    
    private static $owns = [
        'Products'
    ];
}

class Product extends DataObject 
{
    private static $extensions = [
        Versioned::class
    ];
    
    private static $has_one = [
        'Parent' => ProductPage::class
    ];
}
```

If your objects are linked by something other than a database relationship, for instance, a custom
getter that is computed at runtime, the same rules can be applied, as long as you provide an `$owned_by`
setting on the child object.

For more information, see the [DataObject ownership](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/model/versioning/#dataobject-ownership) documentation and the [versioning](/developer_guides/model/versioning) documentation

### ChangeSet batch publishing {#changeset}

ChangeSet objects have been added, which allow groups of objects to be published in
a single atomic transaction.
This API will utilise the ownership API to ensure that changes to any object include
all necessary changes to owners or owned entities within the same changeset.

### New `[image]` shortcode in `HTMLText` fields {#image-shortcode}

The new Ownership API relies on relationships between objects.
Many of these relationships are already made explicit through `has_one`, `has_many` and `many_many`.
Images inserted into `HTMLText` fields (through a WYSIWYG editor) need to be tracked as well.
Instead of `<img>` tags, the field will insert `[image]` shortcodes which point to the database identifier
of the `Image` record rather than its path on the filesystem. The shortcode will be automatically replaced
when the field is rendered. Newly inserted images will automatically receive the shortcode and ownership tracking,
and existing `<img>` will continue to work.

### Renamed DBField and subclasses {#dbfield-rename}

All `DBField` subclasses are namespaced, have a `DB` prefix, and drop any existing `SS_` prefix.
For example, `Text` becomes `SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBText`,
and `SS_Datetime` becomes `SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBDatetime`.
Since they are aliased to their old name, you likely won't need to change your `DataObject::$db` definitions.
If you are instanciating or otherwise referencing those classes directly (not through strings),
they'll likely get rewritten automatically through the
[upgrader tool](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/).

Example:

```diff
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
+use SilverStripe\ORM\FieldType\DBVarchar;

class MyObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $db = [
        'Number' => 'Int',
-        'Time' => 'SS_Datetime'
+        'Time' => 'Datetime'
    ];

    public function TextNumber()
    {
-        return new Varchar('TextNumber', 'Number is ' . $this->Number);
+        return new DBVarchar('TextNumber', 'Number is ' . $this->Number);
    }
}
```

### Removed RestfulService {#restfulservice}

The `RestfulService` API was a (poor) attempt at a built-in HTTP client.
We've removed it, and recommend using [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/) instead.

### Removed Oembed {#oembed}

Instead of Oembed, the framework now relies on [oscarotero/Embed](https://github.com/oscarotero/Embed) to handle getting the shortcode-data for embedding.
If you have custom embedding-code relying on `Oembed`, please refer to the documentation provided by this package.

### Configurable Admin URL {#admin-url}

The default `admin/` URL to access the CMS interface can now be changed via a custom Director routing rule for
`AdminRootController`. If your website or module has hard coded `admin` URLs in PHP, templates or JavaScript, make sure
to update those with the appropriate function or config call. See
[CMS architecture](/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/cms-architecture#the-admin-url) for language
specific functions.

### Custom Authenticators {#custom-authenticators}

The methods `register()` and `unregister()` on `Authenticator` are deprecated in favour
of the `Config` system. This means that any custom `Authenticator` needs to be registered
through the YAML config. Check the [Authentication docs](/developer_guides/Security/Authentication)
for details how to setup a custom handler.

```yml
SilverStripe\Security\Authenticator;
  authenticators:
    - MyVendor\MyModule\MyAuthenticator
```

If there is no authenticator registered, `Authenticator` will try to fall back on the `default_authenticator`,
which can be changed using the following config, replacing the `MemberAuthenticator` with your authenticator:

```yml
SilverStripe\Security\Authenticator:
  default_authenticator: SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator
```

As soon as a custom authenticator is registered, the default authenticator will not be available anymore, unless enabled specifically in the config.
By default, the `SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator` is seen as the default authenticator until it's explicitly set in the config.

Every request is now authenticated against an `IdentityStore` interface.
By default that's a `CookieAuthenticationHandler` and a `SessionAuthenticationHandler`,
which are called from the `AuthenticationHandler`.
If there is a valid `Member`, it is set on `Security::setCurrentUser()`, which defaults to `null`. 
IdentityStores are responsible for logging members in and out (e.g. destroy cookies and sessions, or instantiate them).

### Config is now immutable {#config}

Performance optimisations have been made to Config which, under certain circumstances, require developer
care when modifying or caching config values. The top level config object is now immutable on application
bootstrap, and requires a developer to invoke `Config::modify()` to make mutable prior to modification.
This will immediately have a slight performance hit, so should be done sparingly, and avoided at all
if possible in performance intensive applications.

The `Config::inst()->update()` method is deprecated, and replaced with `Config::modify()->set()` and
`Config::modify()->merge()` to respectively replace and merge config.

When config is merged (either via modification or merged between yml blocks) falsey-values (including nulls)
now replace any prior values (even arrays).

One removed feature is the `Config::FIRST_SET` option. Either use uninherited config directly on the class
directly, or use the inherited config lookup. As falsey values now overwrite all parent class values, it is
now generally safer to use the default inherited config, where in the past you would need to use `FIRST_SET`.

### Replace Zend_Cache with symfony/cache {#cache}

We have replaced the unsupported `Zend_Cache` library with [symfony/cache](https://github.com/symfony/cache).
This also allowed us to remove SilverStripe's `Cache` API and use dependency injection with a standard
[PSR-16](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-16/) cache interface instead.

Caches should be retrieved through `Injector` instead of `Cache::factory()`,
and have a slightly different API (e.g. `set()` instead of `save()`).

```diff
-$cache = Cache::factory('myCache');
+use Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface;
+$cache = Injector::inst()->get(CacheInterface::class . '.myCache');
 
// create a new item by trying to get it from the cache
-$myValue = $cache->load('myCacheKey');
+$myValue = $cache->get('myCacheKey');

// set a value and save it via the adapter
-$cache->save(1234, 'myCacheKey');
+$cache->set('myCacheKey', 1234);

// retrieve the cache item
-if (!$cache->load('myCacheKey')) {
-    // ... item does not exists in the cache
-}
+if (!$cache->has('myCacheKey')) {
+    // ... item does not exists in the cache
+}

// Remove a cache key
-$cache->remove('myCacheKey');
+$cache->delete('myCacheKey');
```

With the necessary minimal config in `_config/mycache.yml`

```yml
---
Name: mycache
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  Psr\SimpleCache\CacheInterface.myCache:
    factory: SilverStripe\Core\Cache\CacheFactory
    constructor:
      namespace: 'mycache'
```

Caches are now configured through dependency injection services instead of PHP.
See our ["Caching" docs](/developer-guides/performance/caching) for more details.
 
Before (`mysite/_config.php`):

```php
Cache::add_backend(
    'primary_memcached', 
    'Memcached',
    [
        'servers' => [
            'host' => 'localhost', 
            'port' => 11211, 
        ]
    ]
);
Cache::pick_backend('primary_memcached', 'any', 10);
```

After (`mysite/_config/config.yml`):

```yml
# setup cache
---
After:
  - '#corecache'
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  MemcachedClient:
    class: 'Memcached'
    calls:
      - [ addServer, [ 'localhost', 11211 ] ]
  SilverStripe\Core\Cache\CacheFactory:
    class: 'SilverStripe\Core\Cache\MemcachedCacheFactory'
    constructor:
      client: '%$MemcachedClient
```

### User-code style upgrades {#usercode-style-upgrades}

Although it is not mandatory to upgrade project code to follow SilverStripe and 
PSR-2 standard it is highly recommended to ensure that code is consistent. The below sections
will assist you with bringing yourself up to speed.

Please note that before upgrading user code style it is necessary to run the standard upgrade path
to fix references and usages of framework API.


#### Updating custom dataobjects to use existing table names

Once you have namespaced your user code it will be necessary to customise the `table_name` config
for your dataobjects, in order to ensure the correct table is used after upgrade. It is recommended
to point this to the base name of the class, excluding namespace, as in 3.x.

```diff
namespace WebDesignGroup\ShopSite;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use Page;
class GalleryPage extends Page
{
+    private static $table_name = 'GalleryPage';
}
```

#### Class name remapping {#class-name-remapping}

If you've namespaced one of your custom page types, you may notice a message in the CMS 
telling you it's obsolete. This is likely because the `ClassName` 
field in the `SiteTree` table still contains the singular model name, e.g. `GalleryPage`
and that when you change it to `WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\GalleryPage` then everything 
works again.

The `dev/build` task is configured to look for a legacy class name mapping 
configuration setting and will update this for you automatically. You can use
this to add DB upgrading rules for your own classes.

For example, you could upgrade references to the newly namespaced Banner class by adding
this to your `mysite/_config/upgrade.yml` file:

```yml
SilverStripe\ORM\DatabaseAdmin:
  classname_value_remapping:
    GalleryPage: WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\GalleryPage 
```

The next time you run a dev/build the class name for all `GalleryPage` pages will
be automatically updated to the new `WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\GalleryPage`

#### PSR-2 Coding Standard compliance {#psr2}

You can use the [php codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) tool
to not only detect and lint PSR-2 coding errors, but also do some minimal automatic
code style migration.

 - Install the necessary library:
   `composer require squizlabs/php_codesniffer`
 - Copy silverstripe standards config file from framework/phpcs.xml to your project root:
   `cp ./framework/phpcs.xml ./phpcs.xml`
 - Run the automatic upgrade tool on your code folder
   `vendor/bin/phpcbf ./mysite/code`
 - Run the automatic linting tool to detect and manually fix other errors:
   `vendor/bin/phpcs ./mysite/code`

Repeat the final step and manually repair suggested changes, as necessary,
until you no longer have any linting issues.

#### PSR-4 autoloading for project code {#psr4}

While not critical to an upgrade, SilverStripe 4.0 has adopted the [PSR-4 autoloading](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
standard for the core modules, so it's probably a good idea to be consistent. 

You can implement this in your composer configuration like so:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "WebDesignGroup\\ShopSite\\": "mysite/src/"
        }
    }
}
```

Now you just need to ensure that each class site in the correct folder location 
(including case sensitivity) to match its namespace. For example,
 `WebDesignGroup\ShopSite\Model\GalleryItem.php` should live at `mysite/src/Model/GalleryItem.php`.

Note that you don’t have to use `src/` as the root folder name. You can continue 
to use `code/` if you want to. SilverStripe has adopted the PSR-4 approach and 
have also started to use `src/` as a default folder location instead of 
`code/`. If you’re going to change, it's probably a good time to do it while you're
upgrading.

For examples, take a look at the file/folder structure and to the 
`composer.json` configuration in either the `framework` or `cms` modules.

Please note that there are changes to template structure which in some cases 
require templates to be in a folder location that matches the namespace of the class 
that it belongs to, e.g. `themes/mytheme/templates/MyVendor/Foobar/Model/MyModel.ss`.

## API Changes {#api-changes}

### General {#overview-general}

* Minimum PHP version raised to 5.6 (with support for PHP 7.x)
* Dropped support for PHP safe mode (removed php 5.4).
* Once PHP versions become [unsupported by the PHP Project](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)),
  we drop support for those versions in the [next minor release](/contributing/release-process 
  This means PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.0 support will become unsupported in Dec 2018.
* Minimum CMS browser requirement raised from Internet Explorer 8 to Internet Explorer 11
* Updated PHPUnit from 3.7 to 4.8 ([upgrade notes](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/wiki/Release-Announcement-for-PHPUnit-4.0.0#backwards-compatibility-issues)).
  Please remove any PHPUnit related `require_once()` calls (e.g. in `FeatureContext`
  definitions of the [behat-extension](https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-behat-extension) module).
  Run `composer require --dev 'phpunit/phpunit:~4.8'` on existing projects to pull in the new dependency.
* `always_populate_raw_post_data` will now raise a deprecation warning in install.php when running in php 5.x,
  unless set to `-1`. This is due to `$HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA` being removed in php 7.
  See the [http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.httprawpostdata.php](php documentation) for more information.
* Admin URL can now be configured via custom Director routing rule

* `ServiceConfigurationLocator` is now an interface not a class.
* `i18nTextCollectorTask` merge is now true by default.
* `Object` has been broken up into various traits, each of which can be added to other objects independently:
  * `Configurable` Provides Config API helper methods
  * `Injectable` Provides Injector API helper methods
  * `Extensible` Allows extensions to be applied
* `Convert` class has extra methods for formatting file sizes in php_ini compatible format
  * `Convert::memstring2bytes()` will parse a php_ini memory size.
  * `Convert::bytes2memstring()` will format the memory size with the appropriate scale.

  service name from the filename. Now the service name will either
  by the array key, or the `class` parameter value.
* Uniqueness checks for `File.Name` is performed on write only (not in `setName()`)
* Created `Resettable` interface to better declare objects which should be reset between tests.
* Added a server requirement for the php-intl extension (shipped by default with most PHP distributions)
* Replaced `Zend_Date` and `Zend_Locale` with the `php-intl` extension.
* Consistently use CLDR date formats (rather than a mix of CLDR and `date()` formats)

### ORM {#overview-orm}

* Deprecated `SQLQuery` in favour `SQLSelect` ([details](#sqlquery))
* Added `DataObject.many_many` 'through' relationships now support join dataobjects in place of
  automatically generated join tables. See the [/developer_guides/relations](datamodel relationship docs)
  for more info.
* Added `DataList::filter()` by null now internally generates "IS NULL" or "IS NOT NULL" conditions
  appropriately on queries.
* Changed `DataObject` constructor to require an additional parameter, which must be included in subclasses.
* `DataObject::db` now returns composite fields.
* `DataObject::ClassName` field has been refactored into a `DBClassName` type field (instead of a string).
* `DataObject::can()` has new method signature with `$context` parameter.
* `DataObject::duplicate()` now requires explicit flag to duplicate `belongs_many_many` (off by default),
  but now works with unsaved relations. By default only `many_many` are duplicated.
* `HTMLText` no longer enables shortcodes by default. Two injector aliases have been created for this
  class which can be used to select the correct behaviour. Use `HTMLText` for shortcodes enabled,
  and `HTMLFragment` without shortcodes enabled (the new default).
* Renamed `String::NoHTML()` to `Plain()`
* Removed `String::LimitWordCountXML()`. Use `LimitWordCount()` instead.
* Removed `String::BigSummary()`. Use `Summary()` instead.
* Changed `HTMLText` limit methods to operate on plain text rather than attempt to manipulate the underlying HTML.
* `FormField::Title()` and `FormField::RightTitle()` are now cast as plain text by default (but can be overridden).
* Renamed `FormField#createTag()` to `FormField::create_tag()`  
* `Hierarchy` class has had much of it's functionality refactored out into `MarkedSet`:
  * `isMarked()`
  * `isTreeOpened()`
  * `isExpanded()`
  * `markByID()`
  * `markPartialTree()`
  * `markExpanded()`
  * `markUnexpanded()`
  * `markToExpose()`
  * `markClosed()`
  * `markOpened()`
  * `markedNodeIDs()`
  * `getChildrenAsUL()` replaced with `renderChildren()`, which now takes a template name.
  * `markingFilterMatches()` (and made protected)
  * `markChildren()` (and made protected)
* Search filter classes (e.g. `ExactMatchFilter`) are now registered with `Injector`
  via a new `DataListFilter.` prefix convention.
  see [search filter documentation](/developer_guides/model/searchfilters) for more information.
* `Permission::flush_permission_cache()` renamed to `reset()` and added to `Resettable` interface.
* Changed `Versioned` constructor now only allows a single string to declare whether staging is enabled or not. The
number of names of stages are no longer able to be specified. See below for upgrading notes for models
with custom stages.
* Renamed `Versioned::reading_stage()` to `set_stage()` (throws an error if setting an invalid stage)
* Renamed `Versioned::current_stage()` to `get_stage()`
* Removed `Versioned::getVersionedStages()`
* Removed `Versioned::get_live_stage()`. Use the `Versioned::LIVE` constant instead.

* Added `Versioned::hasStages()` to check if an object has a given stage.
* Added `Versioned::stageTable()` to get the table for a given class and stage.
* Any extension declared via `versionableExtensions` config on Versioned dataobject must now
`VersionableExtension` interface at a minimum. `Translatable` has been removed from default
`versionableExtensions`
* The default CMS delete behaviour for versioned dataobjects is now to delete from both draft
and live stages, and to save to the archive. There is no longer a separate "Archive" action.
* Any writes to versioned dataobjects (in either Draft or Live) will always write to the draft
(main) table as a source of truth. This means that records created in Live mode will always be
available to the CMS and in draft mode.
* `_versions` suffixed tables are now renamed to `_Versions`. This fix will be automatically
applied during dev/build.
* A lot of standard versioned API has been refactored from `SiteTree` into `Versioned` extension.
* All versioned DataObjects have `canPublish()`, `canArchive()`, `canUnpublish()` permission checks
* All versioned Dataobjects have `doPublish()`, `doArchive()`, `doPublish()`, and `doUnpublish()` actions.
However, `do*()` methods will no longer automatically check `can*()` permissions, and must be done by
usercode before invocation.
* Moved `SiteTree::getIsAddedToStage()` to `Versioned::isOnDraftOnly()`
* Moved `SiteTree::getIsModifiedOnStage()` to `Versioned::isModifiedOnDraft()`
* Moved `SiteTree::isPublished()` to `Versioned`.
* Renamed `SiteTree::getExistsOnLive()` to `isPublished()`

* Added `ChangeSet` and `ChangeSetItem` for batch publishing of versioned dataobjects.
* Added `DataObject.table_name` config to customise the database table for any record.
* Added `DataObjectSchema` class to assist with mapping between classes and tables.
* Changed `DataObject.indexes` to use `columns` instead of `value` to define index contents.
* Changed `Money` to treat values as empty only if `Amount` field is null. If an `Amount` value
  is provided without a `Currency` specified, it will be formatted as per the current locale.
* Removed `DatabaseAdmin#clearAllData()`. Use `DB::get_conn()->clearAllData()` instead
* Moved `SapphireTest` temp DB methods into a new `TempDatabase` class.
  This allows applications to create temp databases when not running tests.
* Moved `SapphireTest::using_temp_db()` to `TempDatabase->isUsed()`
* Moved `SapphireTest::kill_temp_db()` to `TempDatabase->kill()`
* Moved `SapphireTest::empty_temp_db()` to `TempDatabase->clearAllData()`
* Moved `SapphireTest::create_temp_db()` to `TempDatabase->build()`
* Moved `SapphireTest::delete_all_temp_dbs()` to `TempDatabase->deleteAll()`
* Moved `SapphireTest::resetDBSchema()` to `TempDatabase->resetSchema()`
* `DBDate`, `DBTime` and `DBDatetime` have changed methods:
    * Added `getTimestamp()` to get the respective date / time as unix timestamp (seconds since 1970-01-01)
    * Changed `Format()` method to use [CLDR format strings](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime),
      rather than [PHP format string](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php).
      E.g. `d/m/Y H:i:s` (php format) should be replaced with to `dd/MM/y HH:mm:ss` (CLDR format).
    * Added `getISOFormat()` to return the standard date/time ISO 8601 pattern in CLDR format.
    * Changed `setValue()` method to expect dates and times to be passed in
      ISO 8601 format (y-MM-dd) or (HH:mm:ss). Certain date formats will attempt to parse with
      the below restrictions:
      - `/`, `.` or `-` are supported date separators, but will be replaced with `-` internally.
      - US date formats (m-d-y / y-d-m) will not be supported and may be parsed incorrectly.
        (Note: Date form fields will still support localised date formats).
      - `dd-MM-y` will be converted to `y-MM-dd` internally.  
      - 2-digit values for year will now raise errors.
    * Changed `FormatFromSettings()` to default to `Nice()` format if no member is logged in.
    * Changed `Nice()`, `Long()` and `Full()` methods to follow standard formatting rules for the
      current locale, rather than pre-defined formats.
    * Added `Short()` to format concise date/time values, as a shorter version than `Nice`
    * Added `getFormatter()` to return a locale-specific date/time formatter.
    * Added `DBTime::FormatFromSettings()`
* Deprecated globals `$database` and `$databaseConfig`. Use `DB::setConfig()` instead.
* Removed `DataModel`
* Changed `DataObject::can*()` methods to no longer accept a member ID. These must now be passed a `Member` object or left null
* Moved `DataObject::db()` to `DataObjectSchema::fieldSpec()` and `DataObjectSchema::fieldSpecs()`
* Moved `DataObject::manyManyComponent()` to `DataObjectSchema` (access through `DataObject->getSchema()`)
* Moved `DataObject::belongsToComponent()` to `DataObjectSchema` (access through `DataObject->getSchema()`)
* Moved `DataObject::hasOneComponent()` to `DataObjectSchema` (access through `DataObject->getSchema()`)

### Filesystem {#overview-filesystem}

* Image manipulations have been moved into a new [`ImageManipulation`](api:SilverStripe\Assets\ImageManipulation) trait.
* Removed `CMSFileAddController`
* `UploadField::setAllowedFileCategories('image')` now excludes non-resizeable images. 'unresizeable_image' is
  can be used to validate these types.
* `Image_Backend` API now loads and saves from `AssetContainer` instances rather than local files.
* The following File categories have been renamed: 'zip' to 'archive', 'doc' to 'document', and 'mov' to 'video'
* `File::updateLinks()` no longer takes urls as parameters. All file links are now identified either by
  the `DataObject::ID` in a `data-fileid` property, or via shortcodes. This is necessary because file
  urls are no longer able to identify assets.
* Extension point `HtmlEditorField::processImage` has been removed, and moved to `Image::regenerateImageHTML()`
* `Upload::load()` now stores assets directly without saving into a `File` dataobject.
* Protected file storage is now a core Framework API. See [File Security](/developer_guides/files/file_security) for
  more information.
* `File` is now versioned, and should be published before they can be used on the frontend.
  See section on [Migrating File DataObject from 3.x to 4.0](#migrating-file-dataobject-from-3x-to-40)
  below for upgrade notes.
* New filesystem abstraction including new `DBFile` database field to hold file references.
* `ShortcodeHandler` interface to help generate standard handlers for HTML shortcodes in the editor.
* `File::handle_shortcode()` and `Image::handle_shortcode()` have moved to their own classes in `SilverStripe\Assets\Shortcodes`,
  and are named `FileShortcodeProvider` and `ImageShortcodeProvider` respectively.
* `AssetNameGenerator` interface, including a `DefaultAssetNameGenerator` implementation, which is used to generate
  renaming suggestions based on an original given filename in order to resolve file duplication issues.
* `GeneratedAssetHandler` API now used to store and manage generated files (such as those used for error page
  cache or combined files).
* `Requirements_Minifier` API can be used to declare any new mechanism for minifying combined required files.
  By default this api is provided by the `JSMinifier` class, but user code can substitute their own.
* `AssetControlExtension` is applied by default to all DataObjects, in order to support the management
  of linked assets and file protection.
* `ProtectedFileController` class is used to serve up protected assets.
* `AssetAdaptor` has a new config `default_server` which helps tell the code which server type to use if no matching type was found by scanning the server software - defaults to `apache`

The following image manipulations have been removed:

* Renamed `Image::SetRatioSize()` to `Fit()`
* Renamed `Image::SetWidth()` to `ScaleWidth()`
* Renamed `Image::SetHeight()` to `ScaleHeight()`
* Renamed `Image::SetSize()` to `Pad()`
* Renamed `Image::PaddedImage()` to `Pad()`
* Renamed `Image::CroppedImage()` to `Fill()`
* Renamed `Image::AssetLibraryPreview()` to `PreviewThumbnail()`
* Renamed `Image::AssetLibraryThumbnail()` to `CMSThumbnail()`

The following `File` methods have been removed. Since there is no longer any assumed local path for any file,
methods which dealt with such paths may no longer be relied on.

* Removed `File::deletedatabaseOnly()`
* Renamed `File::link_shortcode_handler()` to `handle_shortcode()`
* Removed `File::setParentID()`
* Removed `File::getFullPath()`
* Removed `File::getRelativePath()`
* Removed `File::Content` database field (wasn't used by core)

Image manipulations have been moved out of `Image` and now available to any `File` or `DBFile` which has the
appropriate mime types. The following file manipulations classes and methods have been removed:

* Removed `Image_Cached`
* Removed `Image::regenerateFormattedImages()`
* Removed `Image::getGeneratedImages()`
* Removed `Image::deleteFormattedImages()`
* Removed `Image::handle_shortcode()` moved to `SilverStripe\Assets\Shortcodes\ImageShortcodeProvider::handle_shortcode()`
* Removed `AssetAdmin::deleteunusedthumbnails()`
* Removed `AssetAdmin::getUnusedThumbnails()`
* Removed `Folder_UnusedAssetsField`
* Removed `Folder::syncChildren()`
* Removed `Folder::constructChild()`
* Removed `Folder::addUploadToFolder()`
* Removed `RegenerateCachedImagesTask`
* Removed `CleanImageManipulationCache`
* Removed `Filesystem::sync()`
* Removed `AssetAdmin::doSync()`

### Templates and Form {#overview-template}

* Upgrade to TinyMCE 4.x
* Templates now use a standard template lookup system via `SSViewer::get_templates_by_class()`
  which builds a candidate list for a given class. Actual resolution of existing templates
  for any list of candidates is actually performed by `SSViewer::chooseTemplate`
* `HtmlEditorConfig` is now an abstract class, with a default implementation `TinyMCEConfig` for the built in
  TinyMCE editor.
* `HtmlEditorField::setEditorConfig()` may now take an instance of a `HtmlEditorConfig` class, as well as a
  standard config identifier name.
* `HeaderField` requires a `$name` constructor argument (`new HeaderField('MyName', 'My Title')`
* `FormField` templates no longer look in the 'forms' folder for templates. As all form fields are
  now namespaced, the path for these templates will now match the namespace of the given class instead.
* `$module` parameter in `themedCSS()` and `themedJavascript()` removed.
* Ability to select a theme through `admin/settings` has been removed from `SiteConfig`. Please use `SSViewer.themes` config instead.
* `FormAction::setValidationExempt())` can be used to turn on or off form validation for individual actions
* GridField edit form now has improved support for versioned DataObjects, with basic publishing
  actions available when editing records.
* `PopoverField` added to provide popup-menu behaviour in react forms (currently not available for
  non-react forms).
* Introduction of experimental `FormFactory` API as a substitute for DataObject classes being responsible
  for building their own form fields. This builds a form based on a given controller and model,
  and can be customised on a case by case basis. This has been introduced initially for the asset-admin
  module.
* Introduced `AssetAdmin\Forms\UploadField` as a React-friendly version of `UploadField`. This may also
  be used in normal entwine forms for managing files in a similar way to `UploadField`. However, this
  does not support inline editing of files.
* Added method `FormField::setSubmittedValue($value, $data)` to process input submitted from form
  submission, in contrast to `FormField::setValue($value, $data)` which is intended to load its
  value from the ORM. The second argument to `setValue()` has been added.
* `FormField::create_tag()` moved to `SilverStripe\View\HTML->createTag()`.
* `CompositeField::setID()` is removed. ID is generated from name indirectly.
  Use SilverStripe\Form\FormField::setName() instead
* Changed `ListboxField` to multiple only. Previously, this field would operate as either a
  single select (default) or multi-select through `setMultiple()`.
  Now this field should only be used for multi-selection. Single-selection should be done using
  a regular `DropdownField`.
* `GroupedDropdownField::setDisabled()` now only accepts a list of values
  instead of a list of grouped values. The method now expectes
  a non-associative array of values (not titles) or an `SS_List`.

The following methods and properties on `Requirements_Backend` have been renamed: {#requirements}

* Renamed `$combine_files` to `$combinedFiles`
* Renamed `$combine_js_with_min` to `$minifyCombinedFiles`
* Renamed `$write_header_comments` to `$writeHeaderComment`
* Renamed `$write_js_to_body` to `$writeJavascriptToBody`

* Renamed `get_suffix_requirements()` to `getSuffixRequirements()`
* Renamed `set_suffix_requirements()` to `setSuffixRequirements()`
* Renamed `get_custom_scripts()` to `getCustomScripts()`
* Renamed `unblock_all()` to `unblockAll()`
* Renamed `include_in_response()` to `includeInResponse()`
* Renamed `combine_files()` to `combineFiles()`
* Renamed `get_combine_files()` to `getCombinedFiles()`
* Renamed `clear_combined_files()` to `clearCombinedFiles()`
* Renamed `process_combined_files()` to `processCombinedFiles()`
* Renamed `set_write_js_to_body()` to `setWriteJavascriptToBody()`
* Renamed `set_force_js_to_bottom()` to `setForceJSToBottom()`
* Added `get_minify_combined_js_files()` and `set_minify_combined_js_files()`
* Added `get_force_js_to_bottom()`
* Added `get_write_js_to_body()`
* Changed `includeInHTML()` to remove the first parameter (`$template`)

A new config `Requirements_Backend.combine_in_dev` has been added in order to allow combined files to be
forced on during development. If this is off, combined files is only enabled in live environments.

Form validation has been refactored significantly. A new `FormMessage` trait has been created to {#form-validation}
handle `FormField` and `Form` messages. This trait has a new`setMessage()` API to assign a message, type, and cast.
Use `getMessage()`, `getMessageType()`, `getMessageCast()` and `getMessageCastingHelper()` to retrieve them.

`Form` behaviour methods have been changed:

* `__construct()` now allows a `RequestHandler` to be passed as a first argument, rather than a controller.
  In addition this argument is now optional. This allows forms to be constructed as a model only.
* `validate` is replaced with `validationResult` instead, which returns a `ValidationResult` instance.
  This is no longer automatically persisted in the state by default, unless a redirection occurs.
  You can also save any response in the state by manually invoking `saveFormState` inside a custom
  validation response handler.
* Renamed `setupFormErrors()` to `restoreFormState()`
* Renamed `resetValidation()` to `clearFormState()`
* Added `loadMessagesFrom()` to load a `ValidationResult` into a form.
* Changed `setMessage()` to accept `$cast` as a third parameter (instead of a `$escapeHtml` boolean)
* Removed `messageForForm()`. Use `setMessage()` or `sessionMessage()` instead.
* Added `getSessionValidationResult()` / `setSessionValidationResult()` to get / set session errors
* Added `getSessionData()` / `setSessionData()` to get / set field values cached in the session
* Removed `addErrorMessage()`. Use `sessionMessage()` or `sessionError()` to add a
  form level message, throw a `ValidationException` during submission, or add a custom validator.
* `Form` is no longer a `RequestHandler`, but implements the `HasRequestHandler` interface and returns
  a `FormRequestHandler` instance from `getRequestHandler()`. the `Form` constructor no longer has
  any mandatory parameters, and the first parameter allows a non-`Controller` `RequestHandler` to be
  passed.
* Moved `buttonClicked()` to `FormRequestHandler`
* Moved `checkAccessAction()` to `FormRequestHandler`
* Moved `handleField()` to `FormRequestHandler`
* Moved `httpSubmission()` to `FormRequestHandler`
* Moved `Link()` to `FormRequestHandler`

`Validator` methods have changed:

* Changed `validate()` to return a `ValidationResult` instance.
* Removed `requireField()`. Use `RequiredFields` subclass instead.

`ValidationResult` now has these methods:

* Added `serialize()` / `unserialize()` for saving within session state
* Renamed `messageList()` to `getMessages()`
* Changed `error()` to `addMessage()` / `addError()` / `addFieldMessage()` / `addFieldError()`
* Renamed `valid()` to `isValid()`

`ValidationException` has these changes:

* Changed constructor to remove second argument (`$message`). It now only accepts `$result`,
  which may be a string, and optional `$code`
  
New `DatetimeField` methods replace `getConfig()` / `setConfig()`: {#datetimefield}

* Added `getTimezone()` / `setTimezone()`
* Added `getDateTimeOrder()` / `setDateTimeOrder()`
* Added `getLocale()` / `setLocale()`
* Removed `datavaluefield` config as internal data value is now fixed to ISO 8601 format

The `DatetimeField` has changed behaviour:

* It uses a combined input instead of a composite from `DateField` and `TimeField`
  Consequently, `getDateField()` and `getTimeField()` have been removed.
* It returns [ISO 8601 normalised dates](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#local-dates-and-times)
  by default in `Value()`, which include a "T" separator between date and time. 
  This is required to allow HTML5 input. Either use `setHTML5(false)` to set your custom format,
  or use `dataValue()` to retrieve a whitespace separated representation. 
* It no longer accepts `setValue()` as an array with 'date' and 'time' keys
* Added `getHTML5()` / `setHTML5()`

New `DateField` methods replace `getConfig()` / `setConfig()`: {#datefield}

* Added `getDateFormat()` / `setDateFormat()`
* Added `getMinDate()` / `setMinDate()`
* Added `getMaxDate()` / `setMaxDate()`
* Added `getLocale()` / `setLocale()`

The `DateField` has changed behavior:

* `DateField` no longer provides a jQuery UI date picker (`showcalendar` option),
   and uses [HTML5 date pickers](https://www.wufoo.com/html5/types/4-date.html) by default instead.
* `DateField` provides an optional polyfill for
  [browsers without HTML5 date picker support](http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-datetime) 
* The `dmyfields` option has been replced with native HTML5 behaviour (as one single `<input type=date>`).
* `getClientLocale` / `setClientLocale` have been removed (handled by `DateField->locale` and browser settings)

New `TimeField` methods replace `getConfig()` / `setConfig()` {#timefield}

* Added `getTimeFormat()` / `setTimeFormat()`
* Added `getLocale()` / `setLocale()`

* Removed `NestedForm`
* Removed `FieldList->getTabPathRewrites()`
* Removed `FieldList->setTabPathRewrites()`
* Removed `FieldList->rewriteTabPath()`

* Removed `ValidationResult->message()`
* Removed `ValidationResult->starredList()`
* Removed `ValidationResult->error()`

* Removed `FormField::dontEscape()`. Escaping is now managed on a class by class basis.
* Removed `PermissionCheckboxSetField::getAssignedPermissionCodes()`
* Removed `Requirements::delete_combined_files()`
* Removed `NumericField_Readonly`. Use `setReadonly(true)` instead.
* Removed `SSViewer->set_source_file_comments()`
* Removed `SSViewer->get_source_file_comments()`
* Removed `SSViewer->getOption()`
* Removed `SSViewer->setOption()`  
* Removed `MemberDatetimeOptionsetField` (no replacement)
* Removed `DateField_View_JQuery` (replaced with native HTML5 support in `DateField`)
* Moved `HTMLEditorField_Toolbar` to `SilverStripe\Admin\ModalController`
* Moved `HTMLEditorField_Embed` to`SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\EmbedResource`
* Removed `HTMLEditorField_File`
* Removed `HTMLEditorField_Flash`
* Removed `HTMLEditorField_Image`

### i18n {#overview-i18n}

* Upgrade of i18n to symfony/translation
* Localisation based on language-only (without any specific locale) is now supported
* `i18nEntityProvider::provideI18nEntities()` Now is expected to return only a single array
  map of key to default values.
* i18n keys for '.PLURAL_NAME' and '.SINGULAR_NAME' have been changed back to use the namespaced class names
  for all DataObject subclasses, rather than just the basename without namespace.
* i18n key for locale-respective pluralisation rules added as '.PLURALS'. These can be configured
  within yaml in array format as per [ruby i18n pluralization rules](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#pluralization).
* Moved `i18n.all_locales` config setting to `SilverStripe\i18n\Data\Locales.locales`
* Moved `i18n.common_languages` config setting to `SilverStripe\i18n\Data\Locales.languages`

* Renamed `$extraControllers` to `$extra_controllers` (and made static)

### Security {#overview-security}

 * `LoginForm` now has an abstract method `getAuthenticatorName()`. If you have made subclasses of this,
   you will need to define this method and return a short name describing the login method.
 * `MemberLoginForm` has a new constructor argument for the authenticator class, although this is usually
   constructed by `MemberAuthenticator` and won't affect normal use.
 * `Authenticator` methods `register()` and `unregister()` are deprecated in favour of using `Config`
 * Unused `SetPassword` property removed from `Member`. Use `Member::changePassword` or set `Password` directly.
