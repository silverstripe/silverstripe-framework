# 4.3.0

## Overview {#overview}

 - `DataList::column()` now returns all values and not just "distinct" values from a column as per the API docs
 - `DataList`, `ArrayList` and `UnsavedRalationList` all have `columnUnique()` method for fetching distinct column values
 - Take care with `stageChildren()` overrides. `Hierarchy::numChildren() ` results will only make use of `stageChildren()` customisations that are applied to the base class and don't include record-specific behaviour.

## Upgrading {#upgrading}

### Fetching distinct column values on DataList

Prior to this release `DataList` would erroneously return a distinct list of values from a column on an object.
If this behaviour is still required, please use `columnUnique()` instead.
