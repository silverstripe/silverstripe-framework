# 4.4.0

## Overview {#overview}

 - [Correct PHP types are now returned from database queries](/developer_guides/model/sql_select#data-types)
 
## Upgrading {#upgrading}

 - dev/build is now non-destructive for all Enums, not just ClassNames. This means your data won't be lost if you're switching between versions, but watch out for code that breaks when it sees an unrecognised value!

### Adapting to new `_resources` directory

Update your `.gitignore` file to ignore the new `_resources` directory. This file is typically located in the root of your project or in the `public` folder.

You may also need to update your server configuration if you have applied special conditions to the `resources` path.

## Changes to internal APIs

 - `PDOQuery::__construct()` now has a 2nd argument. If you have subclassed PDOQuery and overridden __construct() 
   you may see an E_STRICT error
 - The name of the directory where vendor module resources are exposed can now be configured via the `SS_RESOURCES_DIR` environment variables and defaults to `_resources` rather than `resources`. This allows you to use `resources` as a URL segment or a route.
