## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit.

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## PHPUnit 9.5 and PHP 8.0 official support{#php8}

Previous Silverstripe CMS Recipe releases could be run against PHP 8.0. However, the Silverstripe CMS Recipe 4.10.0 is the first release to officially support PHP 8.0. 

The major road block to official PHP 8.0 support was our reliance on a deprecated version of PHPUnit. Adding support for PHPUnit 9.5 removed this road block. All core module tests have been rewritten to run with PHPUnit 9.5.

### What about my project test suite?

Silverstripe CMS Recipe 4.10.0 retains support for the `sminnee/phpunit` fork of PHPUnit 5.7. So your project's tests can still be run without modification ... as long as you are not using PHP 8.0. If you want your own tests to run with PHP 8.0, then you have have to upgrade to PHPUnit 9.5 and update your tests to be compatible with the latest PHPUnit API.

We'll be providing guidance on how to transition to PHPUnit 9.5 closer to the release.

## Dropping support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2{#phpeol}

We've recently updated our [PHP support policy](/Getting_Started/Server_Requirements#php). The immediate affects of this changes are:

- The Silverstripe CMS Recipe release 4.10.0 drops support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2. Those two PHP releases have been end-of-life for several years now and continued support would detract effort from more valuable work.
- The 4.11 minor release will drop support for PHP 7.3 later this year.
- We expect to drop support for PHP 7 altogether around January 2023.

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### New `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable

This release adds support for a new `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable, which allows developers to control where a series of "temporary" files are created. These include [Manifests](/developer_guides/execution_pipeline/manifests), [Object Caching](/developer_guides/performance/caching) and [Partial Template Caching](/developer_guides/templates/partial_template_caching).

The environment variable can be set to either an absolute path which must have a leading `/` (e.g. `SS_TEMP_PATH='/tmp/silverstripe/cachedir'`), or a path relative to the project root (e.g. `SS_TEMP_PATH='silverstripe-cache'`). See the [environment management](/getting_started/environment_management) section for more information.

**Please note:** setting this environment variable will impact both requests served by a webserver (i.e. a typical website pageview) and command-line execution. If your webserver user and command-line user are different, or have different filesystem permissions, you may encounter problems when using this setting.

The new `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable replaces the similarly-named `TEMP_PATH` environment variable, which only ever offered partial support for adjusting the temporary files' location. This is because setting a `TEMP_PATH` _environment variable_ would affect [Injector](/developer_guides/extending/injector) service definitions, but would **not** affect code that referenced the `TEMP_PATH` _PHP constant_. The confusion with both environment variables and PHP constants having the same name is why the environment variable has been renamed and prefixed with `SS_`, in-keeping with other environment variables.

The functionality of the `TEMP_PATH` and `TEMP_FOLDER` PHP constants remains unchanged.

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!
