## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit.

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Dropping support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2{#phpeol}

We've recently updated our [PHP support policy](/Getting_Started/Server_Requirements#php). The immediate affects of this changes are:

- The Silverstripe CMS Recipe release 4.10.0 drops support for PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2. Those two PHP releases have been end-of-life for several years now and continued support would detract effort from more valuable work.
- The 4.11 minor release will drop support for PHP 7.3 later this year.
- We expect to drop support for PHP 7 altogether around January 2023.

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### New `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable

This release adds support for a new `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable, which allows developers to control where a series of “temporary” files are created. These include [Manifests](/developer_guides/execution_pipeline/manifests), [Object Caching](/developer_guides/performance/caching) and [Partial Template Caching](/developer_guides/templates/partial_template_caching).

The environment variable can be set to either an absolute path which must have a leading `/` (e.g. `SS_TEMP_PATH='/tmp/silverstripe/cachedir'`), or a path relative to the project root (e.g. `SS_TEMP_PATH='silverstripe-cache'`). See the [environment management](/getting_started/environment_management) section for more information.

**Please note:** setting this environment variable will impact both requests served by a webserver (i.e. a typical website pageview) and command-line execution. If your webserver user and command-line user are different, or have different filesystem permissions, you may encounter problems when using this setting.

The new `SS_TEMP_PATH` environment variable replaces the similarly-named `TEMP_PATH` environment variable, which only ever offered partial support for adjusting the temporary files' location. This is because setting a `TEMP_PATH` _environment variable_ would affect [Injector](/developer_guides/extending/injector) service definitions, but would **not** affect code that referenced the `TEMP_PATH` _PHP constant_. The confusion with both environment variables and PHP constants having the same name is why the environment variable has been renamed and prefixed with `SS_`, in-keeping with other environment variables.

The functionality of the `TEMP_PATH` and `TEMP_FOLDER` PHP constants remains unchanged.

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}
