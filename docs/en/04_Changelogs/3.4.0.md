# 3.4.0 (unreleased)

## Upgrading notes

Upgrading from 3.3 to 3.4 shouldn't require any code changes.

Note that if you are upgrading from 3.1, you should review the [3.2 upgrade notes](3.2.0).

### Other changes to be aware of

These changes are unlikely to affect your upgrade, but we've noted them just in case you had unusual project code that
was affected by these:

 * When FormFields are rendered, leading & trailing whitespace is now stripped. The resulting HTML for form fields is
   the same for the default fields, but if you have a custom form field that is relying on trailing whitespace being
   outputted.
