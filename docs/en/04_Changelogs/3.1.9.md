# 3.1.9

## Upgrading

### File permissions

This release makes an important change to File DataObject permissions in order to close a vulnerability in
file modification privileges.

By default the minimum necessary permission required by any user to modify files has been changed
to CMS_ACCESS_AssetAdmin. If you need unauthenticated users, or users with other rights, to edit certain
files, then you will need to customise this.

E.g.

	:::php
	<?php
	class FileSecurityExtension extends DataExtension {
		public function canEdit($member) {
			return Permission::checkMember($member, 'MyCustomPermission');
		}
	}

An example use case is when you want to use UploadField on the frontend, where files could be uploaded
by non-admin users, and your above logic will need to ensure that those users can edit their own files
after they have uploaded it.

## Security
