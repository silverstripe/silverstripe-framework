# 2.4.8 (2012-10-30) #

## Overview ##

 * Security (Moderate Severity): More solid relative/site URL checks (related to "BackURL" redirection).
 * Security (Moderate Severity): Ensure javascript content type is sent in form responses. If content type is html, and the javascript contains script tags within the content, this content will be executed.
 * Security (Low Severity): Fixed remote code execution vuln in install.php due to inserting unescaped user data into mysite/_config.php. Not critical because install.php is required to be removed on a SilverStripe installation anyway
