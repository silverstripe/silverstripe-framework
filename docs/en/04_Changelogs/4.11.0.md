## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit. 

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Dropping support for PHP 7.3{#phpeol}

In accordance with our [PHP support policy](/Getting_Started/Server_Requirements), Silverstripe CMS Recipe release 4.11.0 drops support for PHP 7.3. We expect to drop support for PHP 7 altogether around January 2023.

## Internal API changes {#internal-api-changes}

   If you've extended CoreKernel and not using the appropriate getter/setter methods, please update your code.
