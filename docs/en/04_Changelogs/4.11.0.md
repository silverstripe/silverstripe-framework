## Regression test and Security audit{#audit}

This release has been comprehensively regression tested and passed to a third party for a security-focused audit. 

While it is still advised that you perform your own due diligence when upgrading your project, this work is performed to ensure a safe and secure upgrade with each recipe release.

## Dropping support for PHP 7.3{#phpeol}

In accordance with our [PHP support policy](/Getting_Started/Server_Requirements), Silverstripe CMS Recipe release 4.11.0 drops support for PHP 7.3. We expect to drop support for PHP 7 altogether around January 2023.

## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Preview any DataObject in any admin section {#cms-preview}

The CMS preview panel has historically been available for `Versioned` `DataObject`s in the Pages admin section. This has now been expanded to allow any `DataObject` (regardless of whether it uses the`Versioned` extension) to be previewed in any section of the CMS.

This can be used to allow content authors to see the content they are creating in the context it will be presented to users. Example use cases include previewing `DataObject`s which belong to a page (e.g. the [dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) allows previewing elemental blocks which are not inline-editable), and previewing `DataObject`s in a custom admin section, such as templates for emails or system-generated PDF documents.

The [Preview Documentation](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/customising_the_admin_interface/preview/) has been updated with code examples which show how to enable CMS preview on `DataObject`s in a couple of different scenarios.

### Meta generator tag now shows framework version number

The meta generator tag, which can be seen in the meta tags when you view source on a regular page, now includes the framework version truncated to show just the major and minor version, e.g. 4.11. 

This version number will provide aggregate installation numbers to the product team who maintain Silverstripe CMS which will be used to make informed product decisions.

If you dislike this behaviour, the entire meta generator tag can be disabled via:

```yml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  meta_generator: ''
```

The version portion of the metagenerator tag can be disabled via:

```yml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
  show_meta_generator_version: false
```

### Other new features {#other-features}

- A new [AbstractGridFieldComponent](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Forms/GridField/AbstractGridFieldComponent.html) class has been added to make it easier to globally add fundamental functionality to `GridFieldComponent`s. All classes packaged with the Silverstripe framework which implement the `GridFieldComponent` interface are subclasses of the new abstract class, making them all `Injectable`. Maintainers of third-party packages which include classes that implement `GridFieldComponent` are encouraged to subclass the `AbstractGridFieldComponent` abstract class.
- New options have been added to the [dnadesign/silverstripe-elemental module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental) to control what content is indexed for searching elemental blocks. see [the documentation](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-elemental/blob/4/docs/en/searching-blocks.md) for details.

## Bugfixes {#bugfixes}

This release includes a number of bug fixes to improve a broad range of areas. Check the change logs for full details of these fixes split by module. Thank you to the community members that helped contribute these fixes as part of the release!

## Dependency and internal API changes {#dependency-internal-api-changes}

- If `guzzlehttp/guzzle` is required, it must now be at least `7.3.0`. This was done to ensure that v2 of `guzzlehttp/psr7` is installed, which is used by `embed/embed` v4
- `embed/embed` has been upgraded from v3 to v4. The internal implementation of the internal `Embeddable` interface has been changed from `EmbedResource` to `EmbedContainer`
