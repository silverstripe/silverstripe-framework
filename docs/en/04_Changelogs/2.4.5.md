### Features and Enhancements

 * [rev:115416] Changed canEdit and canCreate extend to extendedCan

### Bugfixes

 * [rev:115816] #6321 Whitelisted file extensions with uppercase extensions blocked by case sensitive FilesMatch directive in assets/.htaccess (does not affect IIS 7.x which uses web.config)
 * [rev:115720] transaction function names fixed
 * [rev:115460] DateField wrong datepicker-%s.js path (fixes #6296, thanks martijn)
 * [rev:115443] Incorrect call to weekday function in Date class (thanks webbower!)

 * [rev:115440] #6291 Remove rollback action from CMSMain allowed_actions and rely on form action_rollback instead which is safer
