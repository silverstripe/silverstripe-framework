## Upgrading

 * If you have created your own composite database fields, then you should amend the setValue() to allow the passing of
   an object (usually DataObject) as well as an array.
 * If you have provided your own startup scripts (ones that include core/Core.php) that can be accessed via a web
   request, you should ensure that you limit use of the flush parameter
 * Translation entity namespaces can no longer contain dots, since it conflicts with the YAML format. 
 * Translation entities defined in templates now use their fully qualified entity name without dots.
   Before: `BackLink_Button.ss.Back`, after `BackLink_Button_ss.Back`. Please fix any custom language
   files or uses of those entities in custom code.
 * If using "MƒÅori/Te Reo" (mi_NZ) as your CMS locale, please re-select it in `admin/myprofile`
   to ensure correct operation (it has changed its locale identifier)
