# 2.4.1-rc2

## Changelog

### Bugfixes

 * [rev:108207] Re-allowing direct execution in sapphire/thirdparty/tinymce/plugins/spellchecker/rpc.php (necessary for cms spellchecker, was disabled by global .htaccess rule)
 * [rev:108195] #5837 cache_dir not writable by Zend when accessing the CMS, because of Windows default which should be the sapphire TEMP_FOLDER
 * [rev:108193] Bypass !BasicAuth when in CLI mode so unit tests can run (regression from r104962)
 * [rev:108099] Fixing default group selection in 'add member' dialog (in !MemberTableField) (fixes #5836)
 * [rev:108096] AssetAdmin->doUpload() shows JS alert *before* triggering a page reload, as this seems to mess up TinyMCE in Firefox on subsequent page loads (fixes #5838)
