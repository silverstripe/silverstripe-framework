# 3.1.5-rc1

## Upgrading

 * If running an application in an environment where user security is critical, it may be necessary to
   assign the config value `Security.remember_username` to false. This will disable persistence of
   user login name between sessions, and disable browser auto-completion on the username field.
   Note that users of certain browsers who have previously autofilled and saved login credentials
   will need to clear their password autofill history before this setting is properly respected.
 * Test cases that rely on updating and restoring `[api:Injector]` services may now take advantage
   of the new `Injector::nest()` and `Injector::unnest()` methods to sandbox their alterations.
 * If errors could potentially be raised by any `[api:RequestHandler]` class such as a `[api:Form]` or
   `[api:Controller]`, you may now add the new `[api:ErrorPageControllerExtension]` to this class to
   transform plain text error messages into `ErrorPage` rendered HTML errors. In the past this
   behaviour was limited to subclasses of `[api:ContentController]`. By default this extension is now
   added to the `Security` controller, and if this is not desirable then it should be removed
   explicitly via the Config system.
