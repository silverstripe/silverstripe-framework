# 3.0.3 (2012-11-26)

## Overview

3.0.3 provides security fixes, bugfixes and a number of minor enhancements since 3.0.2.
We recommend all current users of 3.0.2 upgrade.

Upgrading from 3.0.x should be a straightforward matter of dropping in the new release.
However, please note the upgrading notes and API changes as listed below.

## Upgrading

Impact of the upgrade:

* Reset password email links generated prior to 3.0.3 will cease to work.
* Users who use the "remember me" login feature will have to log in again.

API changes related security patch a8b0e44:

* `Member::generateAutologinHash` is deprecated. You can no longer get the autologin token from `AutoLoginHash` field in `Member`. Instead use the return value of the `Member::generateAutologinTokenAndStoreHash` and do not persist it.
* `Security::getPasswordResetLink` now requires `Member` object as the first parameter. The password reset URL GET parameters have changed from only `h` (for hash) to `m` (for member ID) and `t` (for plaintext token).
* `RandomGenerator::generateHash` will be deprecated with 3.1. Rename the function call to `RandomGenerator::randomToken`.

### Security: JSONDataFormatter/RestfulServer information leak

Severity: Important

The `JSONDataFormatter` skipped object-level access checks via `canView()`,
which could lead to information leakage (e.g. when used through the
["restfulserver" module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-restfulserver)).
Thanks to Rutger de Jong for reporting.

### Security: Hash autologin tokens before storing in the database.

Severity: Moderate

Autologin tokens (remember me and reset password) are stored in the database as a plain text.
If attacker obtained the database he would be able to gain access to accounts that have requested a password change, or have "remember me" enabled.

### Security: Privilege escalation through profile form

Severity: Moderate

A logged-in CMS user can gain additional privileges by crafting a request
to his/her profile form which resets another user's password.
This method can potentially be used by CSRF attacks as well.
Thanks to Nathaniel Carew (Sense of Security) for reporting.

### Security: XSS vulnerability in "Site Title" CMS input field

Severity: Moderate

The "Site Title" field (SiteConfig.Title) can be altered to contain
unsanitized HTML which is rendered unescaped in the CMS. This can lead
to XSS attacks.
Thanks to Nathaniel Carew (Sense of Security) for reporting.
