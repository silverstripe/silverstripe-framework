## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Image lazy loading {#image-lazy-loading}

Most modern browsers support the ability to "lazy load" images. When an image is configured to be 
lazy loaded, browsers only request the image once it's about to be visible to the users. This 
reduces the initial rendering time for pages. 

From v4.9, Silverstripe CMS lazy loads most images by default. You have the options to opt-out of this 
behaviour globally or on specific image instances.

This feature was implemented in partnership with Google.

Read [Browser-level image lazy-loading for the web](https://web.dev/browser-level-image-lazy-loading/)
on _web.dev_ more information.

#### How developers can interact with image lazy loading

Most images get the `loading="lazy"` attribute added to them. This includes:
- images added via the HTML Editor's ***insert media*** button
- image DataObjects added to templates.

To disable lazy loading for an individual image in a template, use `$MyImage.LazyLoad(false)`.

Image HTML tags (`<img>`) added in templates are not lazy loaded by default. Developers
can manually lazy load these images by adding a `loading="lazy"` attribute.

Read the [Image Lazy Loading](/Developer_Guides/Files/Images#lazy-loading) Silverstripe CMS developer 
documentation for more details and code examples.

#### Opting out of image lazy loading globally
There's some scenarios where you might not want to use the native Silverstripe CMS lazy loading. 
For example, you might already have a custom lazy loading implementation.

To opt out of lazy loading globally, use the following yml config:

```yml
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  lazy_loading_enabled: false
```

#### How content authors can interact with image lazy loading

Content authors can disable lazy loading on images added via the HTML editor field in the 
***Insert media*** dialog by setting the ***Loading*** field to ***Eager***.

Consult the [Insert images](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/4/creating_pages_and_content/creating_and_editing_content/inserting_images/#lazy-loading)
article in the Silverstripe CMS user help for detailed instructions.

### Other new features

* [Dot notation support in form fields](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/9192): Save directly into nested has_one relationships (see [docs](/developer_guides/forms/how_tos/handle_nested_data)).
