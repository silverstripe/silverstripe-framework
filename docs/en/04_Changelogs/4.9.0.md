# 4.9.0 (Unreleased)


## Features and enhancements {#features-and-enhancements}

### Image lazy-loading set by default

HTML `<img>` tags now have the `loading="lazy"` attribute added by default on images that are:
- Inserted via the WYSIWYG editor
- Added to a Silverstripe template as an image object that renders as HTML, e.g. `<div>$MyImage</div>`

Other `<img>` tags such as those hardcoded in Silverstripe CMS templates and HTML returned in API responses remain unchanged.

Individual images can have lazy-loading disabled via the following methods:
- WYSIWYG images - Click on the image, then click the "Edit image" icon.  Modify the value in form control in the image placement form
- Image objects in templates - suffix with `.LazyLoad(false)` in the SilverStripe CMS template (*to be confirmed*)

If you need to globally opt-out of image lazy-loading, for instance if your site already has a custom image lazy-loading implementation, you can do so with the following config:

```
SilverStripe\Assets\Image:
  lazy_loading_enabled: false
```

### Other new features {#other-features}

* [Dot notation support in form fields](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/pull/9192): Save directly into nested has_one relationships (see [docs](/developer_guides/forms/how_tos/handle_nested_data)).
