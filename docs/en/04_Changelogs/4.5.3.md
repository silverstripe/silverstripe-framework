### CVE-2020-9309 Script execution on protected files {#CVE-2020-9309}

Silverstripe can be susceptible to script execution from malicious upload contents under allowed file extensions (for example HTML code in a TXT file). When these files are stored as protected or draft files, the MIME detection can cause browsers to execute the file contents.

#### Risk factors

If your project already includes the `silverstripe/mimevalidator` module, it's already protected. CWP projects are already protected.

If your project includes the `silverstripe/userforms` module or allows anonymous users to upload files, it's at a higher risk because malicious users can create files without requiring a CMS access.

#### Actions you need to take

If your project already includes the `silverstripe/mimevalidator` module, you do not need to do anything. To check if the `silverstripe/mimevalidator` module is installed in your project, run this command from your project root.

```sh
composer show silverstripe/mimevalidator
```

If you get an error, the module is not installed.

**Upgrading to `silverstripe/recipe-cms` 4.5.3 will NOT automatically install `silverstripe/mimevalidator`**. You need to manually install the module `silverstripe/mimevalidator`. To add `silverstripe/mimevalidator` to your project, run this command.

```sh
composer require silverstripe/mimevalidator
```

After installing the `mimevalidator` module, you need to enable it by adding this code snippet to your YML configuration.

```yml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Assets\Upload_Validator:
    class: SilverStripe\MimeValidator\MimeUploadValidator
```

If your project overrides the defaults allowed file types, it's important that you take the time to review your configuration and adjust it as need be to work with `silverstripe/mimevalidator`.

Read the [Allowed file types](/Developer_Guides/Files/Allowed_file_types) documentation for more details on controlling the type of files that can be stored in your Silverstrip CMS Project.

#### Special consideration when upgrading Userforms

The `silverstripe/userforms` module now also includes `silverstripe/mimevalidator` in its dependencies. Upgrading to the following versions of userforms will automatically install `silverstripe/mimevalidator`:

* 5.4.3 or later
* 5.5.3 or later
* 5.6.0 or later (requires CMS 4.6.0)

Userforms that include a file upload field will automatically use the`MimeUploadValidator`. Beware that this will NOT change the default upload validator for other file upload fields in the CMS. You'll need to update your YML configuration for the `MimeUploadValidator` to be used everywhere.

### CVE-2019-19326 Web Cache Poisoning {#CVE-2019-19326}

Silverstripe sites using HTTP cache headers and HTTP caching proxies (e.g. CDNs) can be susceptible to web cache poisoning through the:
* `X-Original-Url` HTTP header
* `X-HTTP-Method-Override` HTTP header
* `_method` POST variable.

In order to remedy this vulnerability, Silverstripe Framework 4.5.3 removes native support for these features. While this is technically a semantic versioning breakage, these features are inherently insecure and date back to a time when browsers didn't natively support the full range of HTTP methods. Sites who still require these features will have highly unusual requirements that are best served by a tailored solution.

### Re-enabling the support for removed features

These features are best implemented by defining a `Middleware`.

The following example illustrates how to implement an `HTTPMiddleware` that restores support for the `X-Original-Url` header and the `_method` POST parameter for requests originating from a trusted proxy.

```php
<?php
use SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\HTTPMiddleware;
use SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest;
/**
 * This is meant to illustrate how to implement an HTTPMiddleware. If you blindly
 * copy-paste this in in your code base, you'll simply replicate the vulnerability.
 */
class InsecureHeaderMiddleware implements HTTPMiddleware
{
    public function process(HTTPRequest $request, callable $delegate)
    {
        // Normally, you would validate that the request is coming from a trusted source at this point.
        // View SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\TrustedProxyMiddleware for an example.
        $trustedProxy = true;
        if ($trustedProxy) {
            $originalUrl = $request->getHeader('X-Original-Url');
            if ($originalUrl) {
                $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = $originalUrl;
                $request->setUrl($originalUrl);
            }
            $methodOverride = $request->postVar('_method');
            $validMethods = ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'HEAD'];
            if ($methodOverride && in_array(strtoupper($methodOverride), $validMethods)) {
                $request->setHttpMethod($methodOverride);
            }
        }
        return $delegate($request);
    }
}
```

To learn more about re-implementing support for the disabled features:
* read [how to configure trusted proxies](/developer_guides/security/secure_coding/#request-hostname-forgery) on the Silverstripe documentation.
* read the [documentation about HTTP Middlewares](/developer_guides/controllers/middlewares/).

### CVE-2020-6164 Information disclosure on /interactive URL path

A specific URL path configured by default through the silverstripe/framework module can be used to disclose the fact that a domain is hosting a Silverstripe application. There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other resources on this path (e.g. a page).

### CVE-2020-6165 Limited queries break CanViewPermissionChecker

The automatic permission checking mechanism in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete protection against lists that are limited (e.g. through pagination), resulting in records that should fail the permission check being added to the final result set.

If your project implements custom GraphQL queries using the `CanViewPermissionChecker`, you should validate that they still work as expected after the upgrade.

Read [Controlling who can view results in a GraphQL result set](/Developer_Guides/GraphQL/Verifying_CanView_Permission)
for more information on updating your GraphQL queries.
