# 4.5.0 (Unreleased)

## Overview {#overview}

 * Removed `use_gzip` option on `HtmlEditorField` which used to compress the rich text editor dependency. 
   No longer required since compression is performed as part of the CMS build automatically.
   See (#832)(https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-admin/issues/832)

## Deprecation

 * `PasswordValidator` methods `minLength`, `characterStrength`, and `checkHistoricalPasswords` are now deprecated from
  4.5.0 onwards (previously 5.0).
