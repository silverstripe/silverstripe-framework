## Major changes

* Minimum PHP version raised to 5.3.3
* Introduction of new parameterised ORM
* Default support for PDO
* Moved SS_Report and ReportAdmin out to a separate module. If you're using
  composer or downloading a release, this module should be included for you.
  Otherwise, you'll need to include the module yourself 
  (https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-reports)
* Moved SiteConfig also out to its own module. This will be included by
  default if you include the CMS module.
  (https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-siteconfig)
* Implementation of new "Archive" concept for page removal, which supercedes
  "delete from draft". Where deletion removed pages only from draft, archiving
  removes from both draft and live simultaneously.
* Most of the `Image` manipulation methods have been renamed

## Deprecated classes/methods removed

* `ToggleField` was deprecated in 3.1, and has been removed. Use custom Javascript with `ReadonlyField` instead.
* `ExactMatchMultiFilter` was deprecated in 3.1, and has been removed. Use `ExactMatchFilter` instead.
* `NegationFilter` was deprecated in 3.1, and has been removed. Use `ExactMatchFilter:not` instead.
* `StartsWithMultiFilter` was deprecated in 3.1, and has been removed. Use `StartsWithFilter` instead.
* `ScheduledTask` and subclasses like `DailyTask` were deprecated in 3.1, and have been removed.
 Use custom code instead, or a module like silverstripe-crontask: https://github.com/silverstripe-labs/silverstripe-crontask
* `Cookie::forceExpiry()` was removed. Use `Cookie::force_expiry()` instead
* `Object` statics removal: `get_static()`, `set_static()`, `uninherited_static()`, `combined_static()`,
 `addStaticVars()` and `add_static_var()` removed. Use the Config methods instead.
* `GD` methods removed: `setGD()`, `getGD()`, `hasGD()`. Use `setImageResource()`, `getImageResource()`, and `hasImageResource()` instead
* `DataExtension::get_extra_config()` removed, no longer supports `extraStatics` or `extraDBFields`. Define your
 statics on the class directly.
* `DataList::getRange()` removed. Use `limit()` instead.
* `SQLMap` removed. Call `map()` on a `DataList` or use `SS_Map` directly instead.
* `Profiler` removed. Use xhprof or xdebug for profiling instead.
* `Aggregate` removed. Call aggregate methods on a `DataList` instead e.g. `Member::get()->max('LastEdited')`
* `MySQLDatabase::set_connection_charset()` removed. Use `MySQLDatabase.connection_charset` config setting instead
* `SQLConditionalExpression/SQLQuery` `select()`, `limit()`, `orderby()`, `groupby()`, `having()`, `from()`, `leftjoin()`, `innerjoin()`, `where()` and `whereAny()` removed.
 Use `set*()` and `add*()` methods instead.
* Template `<% control $MyList %>` syntax removed. Use `<% loop $MyList %>` instead.
* Removed `Member.LastVisited` and `Member.NumVisits` properties, see
  [Howto: Track Member Logins](/developer_guides/extending/how_tos/track_member_logins) to restore functionality as custom code

## New and changed API

* Implementation of a parameterised query framework eliminating the need to manually escape variables for
  use in SQL queries. This has been integrated into nearly every level of the database ORM.
* Refactor of database connectivity classes into separate components linked together through dependency injection
* Refactor of `SQLQuery` into separate objects for each query type: `SQLSelect`, `SQLDelete`, `SQLUpdate` and `SQLInsert`
* PDO is now a standard connector, and is available for all database interfaces
* `DataObject::doValidate()` method visibility added to access `DataObject::validate` externally
* `NumericField` now uses HTML5 "number" type instead of "text"
* `UploadField` "Select from files" shows files in all folders by default
* `UploadField` won't display an overwrite warning unless `Upload::replaceFile` is true
* `HtmlEditorField` no longer substitutes `<blockquote />` for indented text
* `ClassInfo::dataClassesFor` now returns classes which should have tables, regardless of whether those
   tables actually exist.
* `SS_Filterable`, `SS_Limitable` and `SS_Sortable` now explicitly extend `SS_List`
* `Convert::html2raw` no longer wraps text by default and can decode single quotes.
* `Mailer` no longer calls `xml2raw` on all email subject line, and now must be passed in via plain text.
* `ErrorControlChain` now supports reload on exceptions
* `FormField::validate` now requires an instance of `Validator`
* API: Removed URL routing by controller name
* Security: The multiple authenticator login page should now be styled manually - i.e. without the default jQuery
  UI layout. A new template, Security_MultiAuthenticatorLogin.ss is available.
* Security: This controller's templates can be customised by overriding the `getTemplatesFor` function.
* API: Form and FormField ID attributes rewritten.
* `SearchForm::getSearchQuery` no longer pre-escapes search keywords and must
  be cast in your template
* Helper function `DB::placeholders` can be used to generate a comma separated list of placeholders
   useful for creating "WHERE ... IN (?,...)" SQL fragments
* Implemented Convert::symbol2sql to safely encode database and table names and identifiers.
   E.g. `Convert::symbol2sql('table.column') => '"table"."column"';`
* `Convert::raw2sql` may now quote the escaped value, as well as safely escape it, according to the current
   database adaptor's preference.
* `DB` class has been updated and many static methods have been renamed to conform to coding convention.
  * Renamed API:
    * `affectedRows` -> `affected_rows`
    * `checkAndRepairTable` -> `check_and_repair_table`
    * `createDatabase` -> `create_database`
    * `createField` -> `create_field`
    * `createTable` -> `create_table`
    * `dontRequireField` -> `dont_require_field`
    * `dontRequireTable` -> `dont_require_table`
    * `fieldList` -> `field_list`
    * `getConn` -> `get_conn`
    * `getGeneratedID` -> `get_generated_id`
    * `isActive` -> `is_active`
    * `requireField` -> `require_field`
    * `requireIndex` -> `require_index`
    * `requireTable` -> `require_table`
    * `setConn` -> `set_conn`
    * `tableList` -> `table_list`
  * Deprecated API:
    * `getConnect` (Was placeholder for PDO connection string building code, but is made
    redundant after the PDOConnector being fully abstracted)
  * New API:
    * `build_sql` - Hook into new SQL generation code
    * `get_connector` (Nothing to do with getConnect)
    * `get_schema`
    * `placeholders`
    * `prepared_query`
* `SS_Database` class has been updated and many functions have been deprecated, or refactored into
   the various other database classes. Most of the database management classes remain in the database
   controller, due to individual databases (changing, creating of, etc) varying quite a lot from
   API to API, but schema updates within a database itself is managed by an attached DBSchemaManager
  * Refactored into DBSchemaManager:
    * `createTable`
    * `alterTable`
    * `renameTable`
    * `createField`
    * `renameField`
    * `fieldList`
    * `tableList`
    * `hasTable`
    * `enumValuesForField`
    * `beginSchemaUpdate` and `endSchemaUpdate` -> Use `schemaUpdate` with a callback
    * `cancelSchemaUpdate`
    * `isSchemaUpdating`
    * `doesSchemaNeedUpdating`
    * `transCreateTable`
    * `transAlterTable`
    * `transCreateField`
    * `transCreateField`
    * `transCreateIndex`
    * `transAlterField`
    * `transAlterIndex`
    * `requireTable`
    * `dontRequireTable`
    * `requireIndex`
    * `hasField`
    * `requireField`
    * `dontRequireField`
  * Refactored into DBQueryBuilder
    * `sqlQueryToString`
  * Deprecated:
    * `getConnect` - Was intended for use with PDO, but was never implemented, and is now
    redundant, now that there is a stand-alone `PDOConnector`
    * `prepStringForDB` - Use `quoteString` instead
    * `dropDatabase` - Use `dropSelectedDatabase`
    * `createDatabase` - Use `selectDatabase` with the second parameter set to true instead
    * `allDatabaseNames` - Use `databaseList` instead
    * `currentDatabase` - Use `getSelectedDatabase` instead
    * `addslashes` - Use `escapeString` instead
* `LogErrorEmailFormatter` now better displays SQL queries in errors by respecting line breaks
* Installer has been majorly upgraded to handle the new database configuration options
  and additional PDO functionality.
* Created `SS_DatabaseException` to emit database errors. Query information such as SQL
  and any relevant parameters may be used by error handling user code that catches
  this exception.
* The `SQLConditionGroup` interface has been created to represent dynamically 
  evaluated SQL conditions. This may be used to wrap a class that generates
  a custom SQL clause(s) to be evaluated at the time of execution.
* `DataObject` constants CHANGE_NONE, CHANGE_STRICT, and CHANGE_VALUE have been created
  to provide more verbosity to field modification detection. This replaces the use of
  various magic numbers with the same meaning.
* create_table_options now uses constants as API specific filters rather than strings.
  This is in order to promote better referencing of elements across the codebase.
  See `FulltextSearchable->enable` for example.
* `$FromEnd` iterator variable now available in templates.
* Support for multiple HtmlEditorConfigs on the same page.
* Object::singleton() method for better type-friendly singleton generation
* New `Image` methods `CropWidth` and `CropHeight` added
* 'Max' versions of `Image` methods introduced to prevent up-sampling
* Update Image method names in PHP code and templates
  * `SetRatioSize` -> `Fit`
  * `CroppedImage` -> `Fill`
  * `PaddedImage` -> `Pad`
  * `SetSize` -> `Pad`
  * `SetWidth` -> `ScaleWidth`
  * `SetHeight` -> `ScaleHeight`

## Bugfixes

* Reduced database regeneration chances on subsequent rebuilds after the initial dev/build
* Elimination of various SQL injection vulnerability points
* `DataObject::writeComponents()` now called correctly during `DataObject::write()`
* Fixed missing theme declaration in installer
* Fixed incorrect use of non-existing exception classes (e.g. `HTTPResponse_exception`)
* `GridState` fixed to distinguish between check for missing values, and creation of
  nested state values, in order to prevent non-empty values being returned for
  missing keys. This was breaking `DataObject::get_by_id` by passing in an object
  for the ID.
* Fixed order of `File` fulltext searchable fields to use same order as actual fields.
  This is required to prevent unnecessary rebuild of MS SQL databases when fulltext
  searching is enabled.
* In the past E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR would be ignored, and now correctly appear as warnings.

## Upgrading Notes

### UploadField "Select from files" shows files in all folders by default

In order to list files in a single folder by default (previous default behaviour), 
use `setDisplayFolderName()` with a folder path relative to `assets/`:


	:::php
	UploadField::create('MyField')->setDisplayFolderName('Uploads');


### UploadField won't display an overwrite warning unless Upload:replaceFile is true

The configuration setting `UploadField:overwriteWarning` is dependent on `Upload:replaceFile` 
which is set to false by default.

To display a warning before overwriting a file:

Via config:


	::yaml
	Upload:
	  # Replace an existing file rather than renaming the new one.
	  replaceFile: true
	UploadField:
	  # Warning before overwriting existing file (only relevant when Upload: replaceFile is true)
	  overwriteWarning: true


Or per instance:


	::php
	$uploadField->getUpload()->setReplaceFile(true);
	$uploadField->setOverwriteWarning(true);


### File.allowed_extensions restrictions

Certain file types such as swf, html, htm, xhtml and xml have been removed from the list
of allowable file uploads. If your application requires the ability to upload these,
you will need to append these to the `File.allowed_extensions` config as necessary.
Also if uploading other file types, it's necessary to ensure that `File.allowed_extensions`
includes that extension, as extensions passed to `[api:UploadField]` will be filtered against
this list.

### Removed format detection in i18n::$date_format and i18n::$time_format

Localized dates cause inconsistencies in client-side vs. server-side formatting
and validation, particularly in abbreviated month names. The default date
format has been changed to "yyyy-MM-dd" (e.g. 2014-12-31). 
New users will continue to have the option for a localized date
format in their profile (based on their chosen locale).
If you have existing users with `Member.DateFormat` set to a format
including "MMM" or "MMMM", consider deleting those formats to fall back to
the global (and more stable) default.

### Cookies set via Cookie::set() are now HTTP only by default

Cookies set through `Cookie::set()` now default to "HTTP only". This means that scripting
languages like JavaScript won't be able to read them.

To set it back to be non-HTTP only, you need to set the `$httpOnly` argument to false when calling
`Cookie::set()`.

### API: Removed URL routing by controller name

The auto-routing of controller class names to URL endpoints
has been removed (rule: `'$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID': '*'`).
This increases clarity in routing since it makes URL entpoints explicit,
and thereby simplifies system and security reviews.

Please access any custom controllers exclusively through self-defined
[routes](/reference/director). For controllers extending `Page_Controller`,
simply use the provided page URLs.


	:::php
	class MyController extends Controller {
		static $allowed_actions = array('myaction');
		public function myaction($request) {
			// ...
		}
	}


Create a new file `mysite/_config/routes.yml` 
(read more about the [config format](/topics/configuration)).
Your controller is now available on `http://yourdomain.com/my-controller-endpoint`,
after refreshing the configuration cache through `?flush=all`.


	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
	  rules:
	    'my-controller-endpoint//$Action' : 'MyController'


The auto-routing is still in place for unit tests,
since its a frequently used feature there. Although we advise against it,
you can reinstate the old behaviour through a director rule:


	:::yaml
	---
	Name: my-routes
	After: framework/routes#coreroutes
	---
	Director:
	  rules:
	    '$Controller//$Action/$ID/$OtherID':  '*'


### API: Default Form and FormField ID attributes rewritten.

Previously the automatic generation of ID attributes throughout the Form API
could generate invalid ID values such as Password[ConfirmedPassword] as well
as duplicate ID values between forms on the same page. For example, if you
created a field called `Email` on more than one form on the page, the resulting
HTML would have multiple instances of `#Email`. ID should be a unique
identifier for a single element within the document.

This rewrite has several angles, each of which is described below. If you rely
on ID values in your CSS files, Javascript code or application unit tests *you
will need to update your code*.

#### Conversion of invalid form ID values

ID attributes on Form and Form Fields will now follow the
[HTML specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-cdata).
Generating ID attributes is now handled by the new `FormTemplateHelper` class.

Please test each of your existing site forms to ensure that they work
correctly in particular, javascript and css styles which rely on specific ID
values.

#### Invalid ID attributes stripped

ID attributes will now be run through `Convert::raw2htmlid`. Invalid characters
are replaced with a single underscore character. Duplicate, leading and trailing
underscores are removed. Custom ID attributes (set through `setHTMLID`) will not
be altered.

Before:


	:::html
	<form id="MyForm[Form]"
		<div id="MyForm[Form][ID]">


Now:


	:::html
	<form id="MyForm_Form">
		<div id="MyForm_Form_ID">



#### Namespaced FormField ID's

Form Field ID values will now be namespaced with the parent form ID.

Before:


	:::html
	<div id="Email">


Now:


	:::html
	<div id="MyForm_Email">


#### FormField wrapper containers suffixed with `_Holder`

Previously both the container div and FormField tag shared the same ID in
certain cases. Now, the wrapper div in the default `FormField` template will be
suffixed with `_Holder`.

Before:


	:::html
	<div id="Email">
		<input id="Email" />


After:


	:::html
	<div id="MyForm_Email_Holder"
		<input id="MyForm_Email" />


#### Reverting to the old specification

If upgrading existing forms is not feasible, developers can opt out of the new
specifications by using the `FormTemplateHelper_Pre32` class rules instead of
the default ones.


`mysite/config/_config.yml`:


	:::yaml
	Injector:
	  FormTemplateHelper:
	    class: FormTemplateHelper_Pre32


### Update code that uses SQLQuery

SQLQuery has been changed. Previously this class was used for both selecting and deleting, but 
deletion is now handled by the new SQLDelete class.

Additionally, 3.2 now provides SQLUpdate and SQLInsert to generate parameterised query friendly
data updates.

SQLQuery, SQLDelete and SQLUpdate all inherit from SQLConditionalExpression, which
implements toSelect, toDelete, and toUpdate to generate basic transformations
between query types.

In the past SQLQuery->setDelete(true) would be used to turn a select into a delete, 
although now a new SQLDelete object should be created from the original SQLQuery.

Before:


	:::php
	<?php
	$query = new SQLQuery('*');
	$query->setFrom('"SiteTree"');
	$query->setWhere('"SiteTree"."ShowInMenus" = 0');
	$query->setDelete(true);
	$query->execute();


After:


	:::php
	<?php
	$query = SQLDelete::create()
		->setFrom('"SiteTree"')
		->setWhere(array('"SiteTree"."ShowInMenus"' => 0));
	$query->execute();


When working with SQLQuery passed into user code, it is advisable to strictly
cast it into either a SQLSelect or SQLDelete. This can be done by using the new
`SQLQuery::toAppropriateExpression()` method, which will automatically convert
to the correct type based on whether the SQLQuery is set to delete or not.

If a SQLQuery is not converted, then the result of `getWhere` will not be parameterised.
This is because user code written for 3.1 expects this list to be a flat array
of strings. This format is inherently unsafe, and should be avoided where possible.


	:::php
	<?php
	public function augmentSQL(SQLQuery &$query) {
		$query->getWhere(); // Will be flattened (unsafe 3.1 compatible format)
		$expression = $query->toAppropriateExpression(); // Either SQLSelect or SQLDelete
		$expression->getWhere(); // Will be parameterised (preferred 3.2 compatible format)
	}



Alternatively:


	:::php
	<?php
	$query = SQLQuery::create()
		->setFrom('"SiteTree"')
		->setWhere(array('"SiteTree"."ShowInMenus"' => 0))
		->setDelete(true)
		->toAppropriateExpression();
	$query->execute();


### Update code that interacts with SQL strings to use parameters

The Silverstripe ORM (object relation model) has moved from using escaped SQL strings
to query the database, to a combination of parameterised SQL expressions alongside
a related list of parameter values. As a result of this, it is necessary to assume
that any `SQLQuery` object may, and will usually, have un-injected parameters.

All database queries performed through `DataList`, `DataQuery` and `SQLQuery` will continue
to work, as will those through `DataObject::get()` (which returns a filterable `DataList`).
However, any conditional expression that includes values escaped with `Convert::raw2sql()`
should use the new standard syntax. This new querying standard method enforces a much
higher level of security than was previously available, and all code using manual
escaping should be upgraded.

See [the security topic](/topics/security#parameterised-queries) for details on why this is necessary, or
[the databamodel topic](/topics/datamodel#raw-sql-options-for-advanced-users) for more information.

As a result of this upgrade there are now very few cases where `Convert::raw2sql` needs to be used.

Examples of areas where queries should be upgraded are below:

#### 1. Querying the database directly through DB, including non-SELECT queries

Before:


	:::php
	<?php

	// Note: No deprecation notices will be caused here
	DB::query("UPDATE \"SiteTree\" SET \"Title\" LIKE '%" . Convert::raw2sql($myTitle) . "%' WHERE \"ID\" = 1");
	$myPages = DB::query(sprintf('SELECT "ID" FROM "MyObject" WHERE "Title" = \'%s\'', Convert::raw2sql($parentTitle)));


After:


	:::php
	<?php

	DB::prepared_query(
		'UPDATE "SiteTree" SET "Title" LIKE ? WHERE "ID" = ?',
		array("%{$myTitle}%", 1)
	);
	$myPages = DB::prepared_query(
		'SELECT "ID" FROM "MyObject" WHERE "Title" = ?',
		array($parentTitle)
	);


#### 2. Querying the database through `DataList`, `DataQuery`, `SQLQuery`, and `DataObject`

Before:


	:::php
	<?php

	$items = DataObject::get_one('MyObject', '"Details" = \''.Convert::raw2sql($details).'\'');
	$things = MyObject::get()->where('"Name" = \''.Convert::raw2sql($name).'\'');
	$list = DataList::create('Banner')->where(array(
		'"ParentID" IS NOT NULL',
		'"Title" = \'' . Convert::raw2sql($title) . '\''
	);


After:


	:::php
	<?php

	$items = DataObject::get_one('MyObject', array('"MyObject"."Details"' => $details));
	$things = MyObject::get()->where(array('"MyObject"."Name" = ?' => $name));
	$list = DataList::create('Banner')->where(array(
		'"ParentID" IS NOT NULL',
		'"Title" = ?', $title
	);


#### 3. Interaction with `DataList::sql()`, `DataQuery::sql()`, `SQLQuery::sql()`, or `SQLQuery::getJoins()` methods

The place where legacy code would almost certainly fail is any code that calls
DataList::sql`, `DataQuery::sql`, `SQLQuery::sql` or `SQLQuery::getJoins()`, as the api requires that user
code passes in an argument here to retrieve SQL parameters by value.

User code that assumes parameterless queries will likely fail, and need to be
updated to handle this case properly.

Before:


	:::php
	<?php

	// Generate query
	$argument = 'whatever';
	$query = SQLQuery::create()
		->setFrom('"SiteTree"')
		->setWhere(array("\"SiteTree\".\"Title\" LIKE '" . Convert::raw2sql($argument) . "'"));

	// Inspect elements of the query
	$sql = $query->sql();
	$sql = preg_replace('/LIKE \'(.+)\'/', 'LIKE \'%${1}%\'', $sql); // Adds %% around the argument

	// Pass new query to database connector
	DB::query($sql);


After:


	:::php
	<?php

	// Generate query
	$argument = 'whatever';
	$query = SQLQuery::create()
		->setFrom('"SiteTree"')
		->setWhere(array('"SiteTree"."Title" LIKE ?' => $argument));

	// Inspect elements of the query
	$sql = $query->sql($parameters);
	foreach($parameters as $key => $value) {
		// Adds %% around arguments
		$parameters[$key] = "%{$value}%";
	}

	// Pass new query to database connector
	// Note that DB::query($sql) would fail, as it would contain ? with missing parameters
	DB::prepared_query($sql, $parameters);


Also note that the parameters may not be a single level array, as certain values
may be forced to be cast as a certain type (where supported by the current API).

E.g.


	:::php
	<?php

	$parameters = array(
		10,
		array('value' => 0, 'type' => 'boolean') // May also contain other database API specific options
	)
	DB::prepared_query('DELETE FROM "MyObject" WHERE ParentID = ? OR IsValid = ?', $parameters);


#### 4. Interaction with `SQLSelect::getWhere()` method

The `SQLSelect` class supercedes the old `SQLQuery` object for performing select queries. Although
both implement the `getWhere()` method, the results returned by `SQLSelect::getWhere()` will be
parameterised while `SQLQuery::getWhere()` will be a flattened array of strings.

`SQLSelect::getWhere()` returns a list of conditions, each of which is an
associative array mapping the condition string to a list of parameters provided.

Before:


	:::php
	<?php

	// Increment value of a single condition
	$query = new SQLQuery(/*...*/);
	$conditions = $query->getWhere();
	$new = array();
	foreach($conditions as $condition) {
		if(preg_match('/\"Count\" = (?<count>\d+)/', $condition, $matches)) {
			$condition = '"Count" = '.($matches['count'] + 1);
		}
		$new[] = $condition;
	}
	$query->setWhere($new);


After:


	:::php
	// Increment value of a single condition
	$query = new SQLSelect(/*...*/);
	$conditions = $query->getWhere();
	$new = array();
	foreach($conditions as $condition) {
		// $condition will be a single length array
		foreach($condition as $predicate => $parameters) {
			if('"Count" = ?' ===  $predicate) {
				$parameters[0] = $parameters[0] + 1;
			}
			$new[] = array($predicate => $parameters);
		}
	}
	$query->setWhere($new);


In cases where user code will manipulate the results of this value, it may be useful to 
replace this method call with the new `getWhereParameterised($parameters)` method, where
applicable.

This method returns a manipulated form of the where conditions stored by the query, so
that it matches the list of strings similar to the old 3.1 `SQLQuery::getWhere()` behaviour.
Additionally, the list of parameters is safely extracted, flattened, and can be passed out
through the `$parameters` argument which is passed by reference.

Before:


	:::php
	public function filtersOnColumn($query, $column) {
		$regexp = '/^(.*\.)?("|`)?' . $column . ' ("|`)?\s?=/';
		foreach($this->getWhere() as $predicate) {
			if(preg_match($regexp, $predicate)) return true;
		}
		return false;
	}


After:


	:::php
	public function filtersOnColumn($query, $column) {
		$regexp = '/^(.*\.)?("|`)?' . $column . ' ("|`)?\s?=/';
		foreach($this->getWhereParameterised($parameters) as $predicate) {
			if(preg_match($regexp, $predicate)) return true;
		}
		return false;
	}


#### 5. Update code that interacts with the DB schema

Updating database schema is now done by `updateSchema` with a callback, rather than relying
on user code to call `beginSchemaUpdate` and `endSchemaUpdate` around the call.

Since the schema management object is separate from the database controller you
interact with it via `DB::get_schema` instead of `DB::get_conn` (previously named
`DB::getConn`)

Before:


	:::php
	<?php
	$conn = DB::getConn();
	$conn->beginSchemaUpdate();
	foreach($dataClasses as $dataClass) {
		singleton($dataClass)->requireTable();
	}
	$conn->endSchemaUpdate();


After:


	:::php
	<?php
	$schema = DB::get_schema();
	$schema->schemaUpdate(function() use($dataClasses){
		foreach($dataClasses as $dataClass) {
			singleton($dataClass)->requireTable();
		}
	});


Also should be noted is that many functions have been renamed to conform better with 
coding conventions. E.g. `DB::requireTable` is now `DB::require_table`

### Revert to legacy CMS page actions

By default "delete from live" and "delete" actions are deprecated in favour of "unpublish" and "archive".
"unpublish" is an existing action which is functionally equivalent to "delete from live", and "archive" is a new
feature which performs both unpublish and deletion simultaneously.

To restore "delete from live" add the following config to your site's config.yml.
