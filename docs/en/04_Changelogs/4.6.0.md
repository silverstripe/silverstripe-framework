## MySQL tables are auto-converted from MyISAM to InnoDB {#myisam}

Beginning with [4.4.0](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/changelogs/4.4.0/),
our minimum requirement for MySQL is 5.6 (since MySQL 5.5 end of life reached in December 2018).
Starting with MySQL 5.6, [InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-introduction.html)
is the new default storage engine,
replacing the older [MyISAM](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/myisam-storage-engine.html) engine.

Silverstripe CMS already creates InnoDB tables by default,
mainly in order to benefit from their better support for database transactions.
Before MySQL 5.6, InnoDB didn't have a `FULLTEXT` search index,
requiring us to enforce the MyISAM engine when devs opted into this index type
in their particular setup. There are a few ways in which this opt-in can happen:

 * Adding the [FulltextSearchable](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4/src/ORM/Search/FulltextSearchable.php)
   extension to a DataObject, as described in our
   [search docs](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/search/fulltextsearch/)
 * Defining `'type' => 'fulltext'` in `DataObject::$db` column definitions
 * Implementing [DBIndexable](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4/src/ORM/FieldType/DBIndexable.php)
   on a custom `DBField` subclass.
 * Setting `'ENGINE=MyISAM'` in `DataObject::$create_table_options`

This search index is not required to enable simple text search
in the "Pages" section of the CMS, or any ModelAdmin implementations.
We generally recommend to choose a more powerful
[search addon](https://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons?search=fulltext&type=&sort=downloads)
(e.g. based on Solr or ElasticSearch) for website frontend search use cases.

As of 4.6.0, a `dev/build` will automatically switch MyISAM tables to InnoDB,
which automatically recreates any indexes required. If you have large indexes,
this can extend the duration if this task. As usual, back up your database
before upgrading, and test upgrades on non-production systems first.
Our tests indicate that indexes with thousands of records and screen pages
worth of content (15MB index size) are converted in a few seconds.

In order to opt out of this change, you can set the engine explicitly
for your DataObject implementations:

```php
use SilverStripe\ORM\Connect\MySQLSchemaManager;
use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;

class MyDataObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $create_table_options = [
            MySQLSchemaManager::ID => 'ENGINE=MyISAM'
    ];
}
```

## Editing files directly in the insert-media modal{#in-modal-editing}

Editors can now directly edit file details when selecting a file in an UploadField or when inserting media in a
HTMLEditorField. The "image placement" and "file link" forms that show when inserting an image or a link in an
HTMLEditorField have been simplified.

This does mean that the order and structure of fields have changed somewhat. If you have customised the forms in the
asset administration area or in the "Insert Media Modal", you should do some regression testing when upgrading to 
make sure your customisations still work as expected.

If your project uses the popular [jonom/focuspoint](https://github.com/jonom/silverstripe-focuspoint) community
module, you should upgrade it as well.

## MIME Type validation now a core module {#mime-validator}

`silverstripe/mimevalidator` is now a core module and will ship by default on new projects. Projects referencing `silverstripe/recipe-core` will automatically install `silverstripe/mimevalidator` when they upgrade to 4.6.0.

Read [Allowed file types](Developer_Guides/Files/Allowed_file_types) in the Silverstripe CMS doc for all the details.
