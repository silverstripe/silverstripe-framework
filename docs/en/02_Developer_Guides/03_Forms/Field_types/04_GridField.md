summary: How to use the GridField class for managing tabular data.

# GridField

[api:GridField] is SilverStripe's implementation of data grids. The main purpose of the `FormField` is to display 
tabular data in a format that is easy to view and modify. It can be thought of as a HTML table with some tricks.

	:::php
	$field = new GridField($name, $title, $list);



<div class="hint" markdown='1'>
GridField can only be used with `$list` data sets that are of the type `SS_List` such as `DataList` or `ArrayList`.
</div>

<div class="notice" markdown="1">
[api:GridField] powers the automated data UI of [api:ModelAdmin]. For more information about `ModelAdmin` see the 
[Customizing the CMS](../../customizing_the_cms) guide.
</div>

Each `GridField` is built from a number of components grouped into the [api:GridFieldConfig]. Without any components, 
a `GridField` has almost no functionality. The `GridFieldConfig` instance and the attached [api:GridFieldComponent] are 
responsible for all the user interactions including formatting data to be readable, modifying data and performing any 
actions such as deleting records.

**mysite/code/Page.php**

	:::php
	<?php

	class Page extends SiteTree {
		
		public function getCMSFields() {
			$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

			$fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Pages', 
				new GridField('Pages', 'All pages', SiteTree::get())
			); 

			return $fields;
		}
	}

This will display a bare bones `GridField` instance under `Pages` tab in the CMS. As we have not specified the 
`GridField` configuration, the default configuration is an instance of [api:GridFieldConfig_Base] which provides:

 * [api:GridFieldToolbarHeader]
 * [api:GridFieldSortableHeader]
 * [api:GridFieldFilterHeader]
 * [api:GridFieldDataColumns]
 * [api:GridFieldPageCount]
 * [api:GridFieldPaginator]

The configuration of those `GridFieldComponent` instances and the addition or subtraction of components is done through 
the `getConfig()` method on `GridField`.

**mysite/code/Page.php**

	:::php
	<?php

	class Page extends SiteTree {
		
		public function getCMSFields() {
			$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

			$fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Pages', 
				$grid = new GridField('Pages', 'All pages', SiteTree::get())
			);

			// GridField configuration
			$config = $grid->getConfig();

			//
			// Modification of existing components can be done by fetching that component.
			// Consult the API documentation for each component to determine the configuration
			// you can do.
			//
			$dataColumns = $config->getComponentByType('GridFieldDataColumns');
			
			$dataColumns->setDisplayFields(array(
				'Title' => 'Title',
				'Link'=> 'URL',
				'LastEdited' => 'Changed'
			));

			return $fields;
		}
	}


With the `GridFieldConfig` instance, we can modify the behavior of the `GridField`. 

	:::php
	// `GridFieldConfig::create()` will create an empty configuration (no components).
	$config = GridFieldConfig::create();

	// add a component
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldDataColumns());

	// Update the GridField with our custom configuration
	$gridField->setConfig($config);

`GridFieldConfig` provides a number of methods to make setting the configuration easier. We can insert a component 
before another component by passing the second parameter.
	
	:::php
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldFilterHeader(), 'GridFieldDataColumns');
	
We can add multiple components in one call.

	:::php
	$config->addComponents(
		new GridFieldDataColumns(), 
		new GridFieldToolbarHeader()
	);

Or, remove a component.

	:::php
	$config->removeComponentsByType('GridFieldDeleteAction');

Fetch a component to modify it later on.

	:::php
	$component = $config->getComponentByType('GridFieldFilterHeader')


Here is a list of components for use bundled with the core framework. Many more components are provided by third-party
modules and extensions.

 - [api:GridFieldToolbarHeader]
 - [api:GridFieldSortableHeader]
 - [api:GridFieldFilterHeader]
 - [api:GridFieldDataColumns]
 - [api:GridFieldDeleteAction]
 - [api:GridFieldViewButton]
 - [api:GridFieldEditButton]
 - [api:GridFieldExportButton]
 - [api:GridFieldPrintButton]
 - [api:GridFieldPaginator]
 - [api:GridFieldDetailForm]

## Bundled GridFieldConfig

As a shortcut, `GridFieldConfig` subclasses can define a list of `GridFieldComponent` objects to use. This saves 
developers manually adding each component. 

### GridFieldConfig_Base

A simple read-only and paginated view of records with sortable and searchable headers.

	:::php
	$config = GridFieldConfig_Base::create();

	$gridField->setConfig($config);

	// Is the same as adding the following components..
	// .. new GridFieldToolbarHeader()
	// .. new GridFieldSortableHeader()
	// .. new GridFieldFilterHeader()
	// .. new GridFieldDataColumns()
	// .. new GridFieldPageCount('toolbar-header-right')
	// .. new GridFieldPaginator($itemsPerPage)

### GridFieldConfig_RecordViewer

Similar to `GridFieldConfig_Base` with the addition support of the ability to view a `GridFieldDetailForm` containing
a read-only view of the data record.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
The data row show must be a `DataObject` subclass. The fields displayed in the read-only view come from 
`DataObject::getCMSFields()`.
</div>

<div class="alert" markdown="1">
The `DataObject` class displayed must define a `canView()` method that returns a boolean on whether the user can view 
this record.
</div>

	:::php
	$config = GridFieldConfig_RecordViewer::create();
	
	$gridField->setConfig($config);

	// Same as GridFieldConfig_Base with the addition of
	// .. new GridFieldViewButton(),
	// .. new GridFieldDetailForm()

### GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor

Similar to `GridFieldConfig_RecordViewer` with the addition support to edit or delete each of the records.

<div class="info" markdown="1">
The data row show must be a `DataObject` subclass. The fields displayed in the edit view come from 
`DataObject::getCMSFields()`.
</div>

<div class="alert" markdown="1">
Permission control for editing and deleting the record uses the `canEdit()` and `canDelete()` methods on the 
`DataObject` object.
</div>

	:::php
	$config = GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor::create();
	
	$gridField->setConfig($config);

	// Same as GridFieldConfig_RecordViewer with the addition of
	// .. new GridFieldAddNewButton(),
	// .. new GridFieldEditButton(),
	// .. new GridFieldDeleteAction()

### GridFieldConfig_RelationEditor

Similar to `GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor`, but adds features to work on a record's has-many or many-many relationships. 
As such, it expects the list used with the `GridField` to be a instance of `RelationList`. 

	:::php
	$config = GridFieldConfig_RelationEditor::create();

	$gridField->setConfig($config);

This configuration adds the ability to searched for existing records and add a relationship 
(`GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter`).

Records created or deleted through the `GridFieldConfig_RelationEditor` automatically update the relationship in the
database.

## GridFieldDetailForm

The `GridFieldDetailForm` component drives the record viewing and editing form. It takes its' fields from 
`DataObject->getCMSFields()` method but can be customized to accept different fields via the 
[api:GridFieldDetailForm->setFields] method.

	:::php
	$form = $gridField->getConfig()->getComponentByType('GridFieldDetailForm');
	$form->setFields(new FieldList(
		new TextField('Title')
	));

### many_many_extraFields

The component also has the ability to load and save data stored on join tables when two records are related via a 
"many_many" relationship, as defined through [api:DataObject::$many_many_extraFields]. While loading and saving works 
transparently, you need to add the necessary fields manually, they're not included in the `getCMSFields()` scaffolding.

These extra fields act like usual form fields, but need to be "namespaced" in order for the `GridField` logic to detect 
them as fields for relation extra data, and to avoid clashes with the other form fields.

The namespace notation is `ManyMany[<extradata-field-name>]`, so for example `ManyMany[MyExtraField]`.

	:::php
	<?php

	class Team extends DataObject {
		
		private static $db = array(
			'Name' => 'Text'
		);

		public static $many_many = array(
			'Players' => 'Player'
		);
	}

	class Player extends DataObject {
	
		private static $db = array(
			'Name' => 'Text'
		);
		
		public static $many_many = array(
			'Teams' => 'Team'
		);
		
		public static $many_many_extraFields = array(
			'Teams' => array(
				'Position' => 'Text'
			)
		);

		public function getCMSFields() {
			$fields = parent::getCMSFields();

			if($this->ID) {
				$teamFields = singleton('Team')->getCMSFields();
				$teamFields->addFieldToTab(
					'Root.Main',
					// The "ManyMany[<extradata-name>]" convention
					new TextField('ManyMany[Position]', 'Current Position')
				);

				$config = GridFieldConfig_RelationEditor::create();
				$config->getComponentByType('GridFieldDetailForm')->setFields($teamFields);

				$gridField = new GridField('Teams', 'Teams', $this->Teams(), $config);
				$fields->findOrMakeTab('Root.Teams')->replaceField('Teams', $gridField);
			}

			return $fields;
		}
	}


## Flexible Area Assignment through Fragments

`GridField` layouts can contain many components other than the table itself, for example a search bar to find existing 
relations, a button to add those, and buttons to export and print the current data. The `GridField` has certain defined 
areas called `fragments` where these components can be placed. 

The goal is for multiple components to share the same space, for example a header row. The built-in components:

 - `header`/`footer`: Renders in a `<thead>`/`<tfoot>`, should contain table markup
 - `before`/`after`: Renders before/after the actual `<table>`
 - `buttons-before-left`/`buttons-before-right`/`buttons-after-left`/`buttons-after-right`: 
    Renders in a shared row before the table. Requires [api:GridFieldButtonRow].

These built-ins can be used by passing the fragment names into the constructor of various components. Note that some 
[api:GridFieldConfig] classes will already have rows added to them. The following example will add a print button at the 
bottom right of the table.

	:::php
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldButtonRow('after'));
	$config->addComponent(new GridFieldPrintButton('buttons-after-right'));


### Creating your own Fragments

Fragments are designated areas within a `GridField` which can be shared between component templates. You can define 
your own fragments by using a `\$DefineFragment' placeholder in your components' template. This example will simply 
create an area rendered before the table wrapped in a simple `<div>`.

	:::php
	<?php

	class MyAreaComponent implements GridField_HTMLProvider {
	
		public function getHTMLFragments( $gridField) {
			return array(
				'before' => '<div class="my-area">$DefineFragment(my-area)</div>'
			);
		}
	}

<div class="notice" markdown="1">
Please note that in templates, you'll need to escape the dollar sign on `\$DefineFragment`. These are specially 
processed placeholders as opposed to native template syntax.
</div>

Now you can add other components into this area by returning them as an array from your 
[api:GridFieldComponent->getHTMLFragments()] implementation:

	:::php
	<?php

	class MyShareLinkComponent implements GridField_HTMLProvider {
	
		public function getHTMLFragments( $gridField) {		
			return array(
				'my-area' => '<a href>...</a>'
			);
		}
	}

Your new area can also be used by existing components, e.g. the [api:GridFieldPrintButton]

	:::php
	new GridFieldPrintButton('my-component-area');

## Creating a Custom GridFieldComponent

Customizing a `GridField` is easy, applications and modules can provide their own `GridFieldComponent` instances to add
functionality. See [How to Create a GridFieldComponent](../how_tos/create_a_gridfieldcomponent).

## Creating a Custom GridField_ActionProvider

[api:GridField_ActionProvider] provides row level actions such as deleting a record. See 
[How to Create a GridField_ActionProvider](../how_tos/create_a_gridfield_actionprovider).

## Saving the GridField State

`GridState` is a class that is used to contain the current state and actions on the `GridField`. It's transfered 
between page requests by being inserted as a hidden field in the form.

The `GridState_Component` sets and gets data from the `GridState`.
