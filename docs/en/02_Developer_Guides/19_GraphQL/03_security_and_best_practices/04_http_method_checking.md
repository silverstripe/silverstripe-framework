# Strict HTTP Method Checking

According to GraphQL best practices, mutations should be done over `POST`, while queries have the option
to use either `GET` or `POST`. By default, this module enforces the `POST` request method for all mutations.

To disable that requirement, you can remove the `HTTPMethodMiddleware` from your `Manager` implementation.


```yaml
  SilverStripe\GraphQL\QueryHandler\QueryHandlerInterface.default:
    class: SilverStripe\GraphQL\QueryHandler\QueryHandler
    properties:
      Middlewares:
        httpMethod: false
```
