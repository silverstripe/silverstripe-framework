title: Working with generic types
summary: Break away from the magic of DataObject models and build types and queries from scratch.
---

In this section of the documentation, we cover the fundamentals that are behind a lot of the magic that goes
into making DataObject types work. We'll create some types that are not based on DataObjects at all, and we'll
write some custom queries from the ground up.

[info]
Just because we won't be using DataObjects in this example doesn't mean you can't do it. You will lose a lot
of the benefits of the DataObject model, but this lower level API may suit your needs for really specific use
cases.
