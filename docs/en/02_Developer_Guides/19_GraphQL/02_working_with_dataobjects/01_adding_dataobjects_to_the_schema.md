## The DataObject model type

In Silverstripe CMS projects, our data tends to be contained in dataobjects almost exclusively,
and the silverstripe-graphql schema API is designed to make adding dataobject content fast and simple.

### Using model types

While it is possible to add dataobjects to your schema as generic types under the `types`
section of the configuration, and their associated queries and mutations under `queries` and
`mutations`, this will lead to a lot of boilerplate code and repetition. Unless you have some
really custom needs, a much better approach is to embrace _convention over configuration_
and use the `models` section of the config.

**Model types** are types that rely on external classes to tell them who they are and what
they can and cannot do. The model can define and resolve fields, auto-generate queries
and mutations, and more.

Naturally, this module comes bundled with a model type for subclasses of `DataObject`.

Let's use the `models` config to expose some content.

**app/_graphql/models.yml**
```
Page:
  fields: '*'
  operations: '*'
```

The class `Page` is a subclass of `DataObject`, so the bundled model
type will kick in here and provide a lot of assistance in building out this part of our API.

Case in point, by supplying a value of `*` for `fields` , we're saying that we want _all_ of the fields
on site tree. This includes the first level of relationships, as well, as defined on `has_one`, `has_many`,
or `many_many`.

[notice]
Fields on relationships will not inherit the `*` fields selector, and will only expose their ID by default.
[/notice]

The `*` value on `operations` tells the schema to create all available queries and mutations
 for the dataobject, including:

* `read`
* `readOne`
* `create`
* `update`
* `delete`

Now that we've changed our schema, we need to build it using the `build-schema` task:

`$ vendor/bin/sake dev/graphql/build schema=default`

Now, we can access our schema on the default graphql endpoint, `/graphql`.

Test it out!

A query:
```graphql
query {
  readPages {
    nodes {
      title
      content
      ... on BlogPage {
        date(format: NICE)
        comments {
          nodes {
            comment
            author {
              firstName
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
}
```

[info]
Note the use of the default arguments on `date`. Fields created from `DBFields`
generate their own default sets of arguments. For more information, see the
[DBFieldArgs](query_plugins#dbfieldargs) for more information.
[/info]


A mutation:
```graphql
mutation {
  createPage(input: {
    title: "my page"
  }) {
    title
    id
  }
}
```

[/info]

### Configuring operations

You may not always want to add _all_ operations with the `*` wildcard. You can allow those you
want by setting them to `true` (or `false` to remove them).

**app/_graphql/models.yml**
```
Page:
  fields: '*'
  operations:
    read: true
    create: true
```

Operations are also configurable, and accept a nested map of config.

**app/_graphql/models.yml**
```
Page:
  fields: '*'
  operations:
    create: true
    read:
      name: getAllThePages
```

#### Customising the input types

The input types, specifically in `create` and `update` can be customised with a
list of fields, which can include explicitly _disallowed_ fields.

**app/_graphql/models.yml**
```
Page:
  fields: '*'
  operations:
    create:
      fields:
        title: true
        content: true
    update:
      fields:
        '*': true
        sensitiveField: false
```

### Adding more fields

Let's add some more dataobjects, but this time, we'll only add a subset of fields and operations.

*app/_graphql/models.yml*
```yaml
Page:
  fields: '*'
  operations: '*'
MyProject\Models\Product:
  fields:
    onSale: true
    title: true
    price: true
  operations:
    delete: true
MyProject\Models\ProductCategory:
  fields:
    title: true
    featured: true
```

[notice]
A couple things to note here:

* By assigning a value of `true` to the field, we defer to the model to infer the type for the field. To override that, we can always add a `type` property:

```yaml
onSale:
  type: Boolean
```

* The mapping of our field names to the DataObject property is case-insensitive. It is a
convention in GraphQL APIs to use lowerCamelCase fields, so this is given by default.

[/notice]

### Bulk loading models

It's likely that in your application, you have a whole collection of classes you want exposed to the API, with roughly
the same fields and operations exposed on them. It can be really tedious to write a new declaration for every single
dataobject in your project, and as you add new ones, there's a bit of overhead in remembering to add it to the
GraphQL schema.

Common use cases might be:

* Add everything in `App\Models`
* Add every implementation of `BaseElement`
* Add anything with the `Versioned` extension
* Add everything that matches `src/*Model.php`

You can create logic like this using the `bulkLoad` configuration file, which allows you to specify groups of directives
that load a bundle of classes and apply the same set of configuration to all of them.


**_graphql/bulkLoad.yml**
```yaml
elemental: # An arbitrary key to define what these directives are doing
  # Load all content blocks
  load:
    inheritanceLoader:
      include:
          - DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement
      exclude:
          - MyApp\Elements\MySecretElement
  # Add all fields and read operations
  apply:
    fields:
      '*': true
    operations:
      read: true
      readOne: true      
app:
  # Load everything in our app that has the Versioned extension
  load:
    namespaceLoader:
      include:
        - MyApp\Models\*
    extensionLoader:
      include:
        - SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned
    filepathLoader:
      exclude:
        - app/src/Models/*.secret.php
  apply:
    fields:
      '*': true
    operations:
      '*': true
```

By default, four loaders are provided to you to help gather specific classnames:

#### By namespace
* **Identifier**: `namespaceLoader`
* **Description**: Include or exclude classes based on their namespace  
* **Example**: `include: [MyApp\Models\*]`
  
#### By inheritance

* **Identifier**: `inheritanceLoader`
* **Description**: Include or exclude everything that matches or extends a given base class
* **Example**: `include: [DNADesign\Elemental\Models\BaseElement]`

#### By applied extension

* **Identifier**: `extensionLoader`
* **Description**: Include or exclude any class that has a given extension applied
* **Example**: `include: [SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned]`
  
#### By filepath

* **Identifier**: `filepathLoader`
* **Description**: Include or exclude any classes in files matching a given glob expression, relative to the base path. Module syntax is allowed. 
* **Examples**:
  - `include: [ 'src/models/*.model.php' ]`
  - `include: [ 'somevendor/somemodule: src/Models/*.php' ]`    

Each block starts with a collection of all classes that gets filtered as each loader runs. The primary job
of a loader is to _remove_ classes from the entire collection, not add them in.

[info]
`exclude` directives will always supersede `include` directives.
[/info]

[info]
If you find that this paints with too big a brush, you can always override individual models explicitly in `models.yml`.
The bulk loaders run _before_ the models.yml config is loaded.
[/info]

#### DataObjects subclasses are the default starting point

Because this is Silverstripe CMS, and it's likely that you're using dataobject models only, the bulk loaders start with an
initial filter, which is defined as follows:

```yaml
inheritanceLoader:
  include:
    - SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject
```

This ensures that at a bare minimum, you're always filtering by dataobject classes only. If, for some reason, you
have a non-dataobject class in `App\Models\*`, it will automatically be filtered out due to this default setting.

This default is configured in the `defaultBulkLoad` setting in your schema config. Should you ever want to disable
that, just set it to `false`.

**_graphql/config.yml**
```
defaultBulkLoad: false
```

#### Creating your own bulk loader

Bulk loaders must extend `SilverStripe\GraphQL\Schema\BulkLoader\AbstractBulkLoader`.  They need to declare an
identifier (e.g. `namespaceLoader`) to be referenced in the config, and they must provide a
`collect(Collection $collection): Collection` which returns a new `Collection` instance once the loader has done its
work parsing through the `include` and `exclude` directives.

Bulk loaders are automatically registered. Just creating the class is all you need to do to have it available for use
in your `bulkLoad.yml` file.


### Customising model fields

You don't have to rely on the model to tell you how fields should resolve. Just like
generic types, you can customise them with arguments and resolvers.

*app/_graphql/models.yml*
```yaml
MyProject\Models\Product:
  fields:
    title:
      type: String
      resolver: [ 'MyProject\Resolver', 'resolveSpecialTitle' ]
    'price(currency: String = "NZD")': true
```

For more information on custom arguments and resolvers, see the [adding arguments](../working_with_generic_types/adding_arguments) and [resolver discovery](../working_with_generic_types/resolver_discovery) documentation.

### Excluding or customising "*" declarations

You can use the `*` as a field or operation, and anything that follows it will override the
all-inclusive collection. This is almost like a spread operator in Javascript:

```js
const newObj = {...oldObj, someProperty: 'custom' }
```

Here's an example:

**app/_graphql/models.yml**
```yaml
Page:
  fields:
    '*': true # Get everything
    sensitiveData: false # hide this field
    'content(summaryLength: Int)': true # add an argument to this field
  operations:
    '*': true
    read:
      plugins:
        paginateList: false # don't paginate the read operation
```

### Disallowed fields {#disallowed-fields}

While selecting all fields via `*` is useful, there are some fields that you
don't want to accidentally expose, especially if you're a module author
and expect models within this code to be used through custom GraphQL endpoints.
For example, a module might add a secret "preview token" to each `SiteTree`.
A custom GraphQL endpoint might have used `fields: '*'` on `SiteTree` to list pages
on the public site, which now includes a sensitive field.

The `graphql_blacklisted_fields` property on `DataObject` allows you to
disallow fields globally for all GraphQL schemas.
This block list applies for all operations (read, update, etc).  

**app/_config/graphql.yml**
```yaml
SilverStripe\CMS\Model\SiteTree:
    graphql_blacklisted_fields:
      myPreviewTokenField: true
```

### Model configuration

There are several settings you can apply to your model class (typically `DataObjectModel`),
but because they can have distinct values _per schema_, the standard `_config` layer is not
an option. Model configuration has to be done within the schema config in the `modelConfig`
subsection.

### Customising the type name

Most DataObject classes are namespaced, so converting them to a type name ends up
being very verbose. As a default, the `DataObjectModel` class will use the "short name"
of your DataObject as its typename (see: `ClassInfo::shortName()`). That is,
`MyProject\Models\Product` becomes `Product`.

Given the brevity of these type names, it's not inconceivable that you could run into naming
collisions, particularly if you use feature-based namespacing. Fortunately, there are
hooks you have available to help influence the typename.

#### Explicit type mapping

You can explicitly provide type name for a given class using the `typeMapping` setting in your schema config.

**app/_graphql/config.yml**
```yaml
typeMapping:
  MyProject\MyApp\Page: SpecialPage
```

It may be necessary to use `typeMapping` in projects that have a lot of similar class names in different namespaces, which will cause a collision
when the type name is derived from the class name. The most case for this
is the `Page` class, which is both at the root namespace and often in your
app namespace, e.g. `MyApp\Models\Page`.





#### The type formatter

The `type_formatter` is a callable that can be set on the `DataObjectModel` config. It takes
the `$className` as a parameter.

Let's turn `MyProject\Models\Product` into the more specific `MyProjectProduct`

*app/_graphql/config.yml*
```yaml
modelConfig:
  DataObject: 
    type_formatter: ['MyProject\Formatters', 'formatType' ]
```

[info]
In the above example, `DataObject` is the result of the `DataObjectModel::getIdentifier()`. Each
model class must declare one of these.
[/info]

Your formatting function could look something like:

```php
public static function formatType(string $className): string
{
    $parts = explode('\\', $className);
    if (count($parts) === 1) {
        return $className;
    }
    $first = reset($parts);
    $last = end($parts);

    return $first . $last;
}
```

#### The type prefix

You can also add prefixes to all your DataObject types. This can be a scalar value or a callable,
using the same signature as `type_formatter`.

*app/_graphql/config.yml*
```yaml
modelConfig:
  DataObject
    type_prefix: 'MyProject'
```
