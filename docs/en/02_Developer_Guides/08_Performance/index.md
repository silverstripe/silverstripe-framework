introduction: Make your applications faster by learning how to write more scalable code and ways to cache your important information.

The following guide describes the common ways to speed your SilverStripe website up. The general rules for getting 
the best performance out of SilverStripe include running the latest versions of PHP alongside a 
[opcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode) cache such as [XCache](http://xcache.lighttpd.net/) or 
[APC](http://nz2.php.net/manual/en/intro.apc.php).

If you're running shared hosting, make sure your host meets the minimum system requirements and has activated one of the
PHP opcode caches to achieve the best results for your application. Once your hardware is performing it's best, dig
