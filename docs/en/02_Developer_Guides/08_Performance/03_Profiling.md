# Profiling

Profiling is the best way to identify bottle necks and other slow moving parts of your application prime for 
optimization. 

SilverStripe does not include any profiling tools out of the box, but we recommend the use of existing tools such as 
[XHProf](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/) and [XDebug](http://xdebug.org/).
