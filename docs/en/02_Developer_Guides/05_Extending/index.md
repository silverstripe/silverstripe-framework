title: Extending SilverStripe
summary: Understand the ways to modify the built-in functionality through Extensions, Subclassing and Dependency Injection.
introduction: SilverStripe is easily extensible to meet custom application requirements. This guide covers the wide range of API's to modify built-in functionality and make your own code easily extensible.

No two applications are ever going to be the same and SilverStripe is built with this in mind. The core framework 
includes common functionality and default behaviors easily complemented with add-ons such as modules, widgets and 
themes. 

SilverStripe includes a myriad of extension API's such as *Extension Hooks* and support for programming patterns 
such Dependency Injection. Allowing developers to tailor the framework to their needs without modifying the core 
framework.
