# HTTP Middlewares

HTTP Middlewares allow you to put code that will run before or after. These might be used for
authentication, logging, caching, request processing, and many other purposes. Note this interface
replaces the SilverStripe 3 interface [RequestFilter](api:SilverStripe\Control\RequestFilter), which still works but is deprecated.

To create a middleware class, implement `SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\HTTPMiddleware` and define the
`process(HTTPRequest $request, callable $delegate)` method. You can do anything you like in this
method, but to continue normal execution, you should call `$response = $delegate($request)`
at some point in this method.

In addition, you should return an `HTTPResponse` object. In normal cases, this should be the
`$response` object returned by `$delegate`, perhaps with some modification. However, sometimes you
will deliberately return a different response, e.g. an error response or a redirection.

**app/code/CustomMiddleware.php**

```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\HTTPMiddleware;
use SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest;

class CustomMiddleware implements HTTPMiddleware
{
    public $Secret = 'SECRET';

    public function process(HTTPRequest $request, callable $delegate)
    {
        // You can break execution by not calling $delegate.
        if ($request->getHeader('X-Special-Header') !== $this->Secret) {
            return new HTTPResponse('You missed the special header', 400);
        }

        // You can modify the request before
        // For example, this might force JSON responses
        $request->addHeader('Accept', 'application/json');

        // If you want normal behaviour to occur, make sure you call $delegate($request)
        $response = $delegate($request);

        // You can modify the response after it has been generated
        $response->addHeader('X-Middleware-Applied', 'CustomMiddleware');

        // Don't forget to the return the response!
        return $response;
    }
}
```

Once you have created your middleware class, you must attach it to the `Director` config to make
use of it.

## Global middleware

By adding the service or class name to the `Director.Middlewares` property via injector,
array, a middleware will be executed on every request:

**app/_config/app.yml**


```yaml
---
Name: myrequestprocessors
After:
  - requestprocessors
---
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Director:
    properties:
      Middlewares:
        CustomMiddleware: %$CustomMiddleware
```


Because these are service names, you can configure properties into a custom service if you would
like:

**app/_config/app.yml**

```yaml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SilverStripe\Control\Director:
    properties:
      Middlewares:
        CustomMiddleware: %$ConfiguredMiddleware
  ConfiguredMiddleware:
   class: 'CustomMiddleware'
   properties:
     Secret: "DIFFERENT-ONE"
```

## Route-specific middleware

Alternatively, you can apply middlewares to a specific route. These will be processed after the
global middlewares. You can do this by using the `RequestHandlerMiddlewareAdapter` class
as a replacement for your controller, and register it as a service with a `Middlewares`
property. The controller which does the work should be registered under the
`RequestHandler` property.

**app/_config/app.yml**

```yaml
SilverStripe\Core\Injector\Injector:
  SpecialRouteMiddleware:
    class: SilverStripe\Control\Middleware\RequestHandlerMiddlewareAdapter
    properties:
      RequestHandler: %$MyController
      Middlewares:
        - %$CustomMiddleware
        - %$AnotherMiddleware
SilverStripe\Control\Director:
  rules:
    special\section:
      Controller: %$SpecialRouteMiddleware
```

## Application middleware

Some use cases will require a middleware to run before the Silverstripe CMS has been fully bootstrapped (e.g.: Updating 
the HTTPRequest before Silverstripe CMS routes it to a controller). This can be achieved by editing the Silverstripe 
CMS entry point file.

This file will be located in your own codebase at `public/index.php`, or directly in your project root at `index.php` 
if your project doesn't use the public web root. Find the line that instantiate `HTTPApplication`. Call the 
`addMiddleware` method on the `HTTPApplication` instance and pass it an instance of your middleware. This must be done
before the request is handled.

```php
// Default application
$kernel = new CoreKernel(BASE_PATH);
$app = new HTTPApplication($kernel);

$app->addMiddleware(new MyApplicationMiddleware());

$response = $app->handle($request);
$response->output();
```

Beware that by this point, the Silverstripe framework features you normally rely on won't be 
available in your middleware or in `index.php` because they won't have been initialised yet. (e.g.: ORM, Injector, services configured by Injector)

For example, Silverstripe's autoloading functionality won't work in `index.php`. So you might have to take additional
steps to load your custom middleware class.

[Configuring autoloading in your `composer.json` file](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload) is the best
way to achieve this. Remember to call `composer dump-autoload` to regenerate your autoloader. 

Alternatively, you can manually include the file containing your custom middleware with a `require` call. e.g.: 
`require __DIR__.'/../app/src/MyApplicationMiddleware.php';`
