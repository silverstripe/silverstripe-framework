# Introduction to Controllers

The following example is for a simple [Controller](api:SilverStripe\Control\Controller) class. When building off the SilverStripe Framework you will
subclass the base `Controller` class.

**app/code/controllers/TeamController.php**

```php
use SilverStripe\Control\Controller;
use SilverStripe\Control\HTTPRequest;

class TeamController extends Controller 
{
        
    private static $allowed_actions = [
        'players',
        'index'
    ];
    
    public function index(HTTPRequest $request) 
    {
        // ..
    }

    public function players(HTTPRequest $request) 
    {
        print_r($request->allParams());
    }
}
```

## Routing

We need to define the URL that this controller can be accessed on. In our case, the `TeamsController` should be visible 
at http://yoursite.com/teams/ and the `players` custom action is at http://yoursite.com/team/players/.

[info]
If you're using the `cms` module with and dealing with `Page` objects then for your custom `Page Type` controllers you 
would extend `ContentController` or `PageController`. You don't need to define the routes value as the `cms` handles 
routing.
[/info]

[alert]
Make sure that after you have modified the `routes.yml` file, that you clear your SilverStripe caches using `?flush=1`.
[/alert]

**app/_config/routes.yml**

```yml
---
Name: approutes
After: framework/_config/routes#coreroutes
---
SilverStripe\Control\Director:
  rules:
    'teams//$Action/$ID/$Name': 'TeamController'
```

For more information about creating custom routes, see the [Routing](routing) documentation.

## Actions

Controllers respond by default to an `index` method. You don't need to define this method (as it's assumed) but you
can override the `index()` response to provide custom data back to the [Template and Views](../templates). 

[notice]
It is standard in SilverStripe for your controller actions to be `lowercasewithnospaces`
[/notice]

Action methods can return one of four main things:

* an array. In this case the values in the array are available in the templates and the controller completes as usual by returning a [HTTPResponse](api:SilverStripe\Control\HTTPResponse) with the body set to the current template.
* `HTML`. SilverStripe will wrap the `HTML` into a `HTTPResponse` and set the status code to 200.
* an [HTTPResponse](api:SilverStripe\Control\HTTPResponse) containing a manually defined `status code` and `body`.
* an [HTTPResponse_Exception](api:SilverStripe\Control\HTTPResponse_Exception). A special type of response which indicates an error. By returning the exception, the execution pipeline can adapt and display any error handlers.

**app/code/controllers/TeamController.php**

```php
/**
 * Return some additional data to the current response that is waiting to go out, this makes $Title set to 
 * 'MyTeamName' and continues on with generating the response.
 */
public function index(HTTPRequest $request) 
{
    return [
        'Title' => 'My Team Name'
    ];
}

/**
 * We can manually create a response and return that to ignore any previous data.
 */
public function someaction(HTTPRequest $request) 
{
    $this->setResponse(new HTTPResponse());
    $this->getResponse()->setStatusCode(400);
    $this->getResponse()->setBody('invalid');

    return $this->getResponse();
}

/**
 * Or, we can modify the response that is waiting to go out.
 */
public function anotheraction(HTTPRequest $request) 
{
    $this->getResponse()->setStatusCode(400);

    return $this->getResponse();
}

/**
 * We can render HTML and leave SilverStripe to set the response code and body.
 */
public function htmlaction() 
{
    return $this->customise(new ArrayData([
        'Title' => 'HTML Action'
    ]))->renderWith('MyCustomTemplate');
}

/**
 * We can send stuff to the browser which isn't HTML
 */
public function ajaxaction() 
{
    $this->getResponse()->setBody(json_encode([
        'json' => true
    ]));

    $this->getResponse()->addHeader("Content-type", "application/json");

    return $this->getResponse().
}
```

For more information on how a URL gets mapped to an action see the [Routing](routing) documentation.

## Security

See the [Access Controller](access_control) documentation.

## Templates

Controllers are automatically rendered with a template that makes their name. Our `TeamsController` would be rendered
with a `TeamsController.ss` template. Individual actions are rendered in `TeamsController_{actionname}.ss`. 

If a template of that name does not exist, then SilverStripe will fall back to the `TeamsController.ss` then to 
`Controller.ss`.

Controller actions can use `renderWith` to override this template selection process as in the previous example with 
`htmlaction`. `MyCustomTemplate.ss` would be used rather than `TeamsController`.

For more information about templates, inheritance and how to render into views, See the 
[Templates and Views](../templates) documentation.

## Link

Each controller should define a `Link()` method. This should be used to avoid hard coding your routing in views,
as well as give other features in SilverStripe the ability to influence link behaviour.

**app/code/controllers/TeamController.php**

```php
public function Link($action = null) 
{
    // Construct link with graceful handling of GET parameters
    $link = Controller::join_links('teams', $action);
    
    // Allow Versioned and other extension to update $link by reference.
    $this->extend('updateLink', $link, $action);
    
    return $link;
}
``` 

## Connecting Pages to Controllers
By default, a controller for a page type must reside in the same namespace as its page. If you find that your controllers are in a different namespace then you'll need to overide SiteTree::getControllerName().

Example controller:
```php
namespace App\Controller;

use SilverStripe\Control\Controller;

class TeamPageController extends Controller 
{
    public function getExample()
    {
        return 'example';
    }
}
```

Example page:
```php
namespace App\Page;

use App\Controller\TeamPageController;
use Page;

class TeamPage extends Page
{
    public function getControllerName()
    {
        return TeamPageController::class;
    }
}
```
You'd now be able to access methods of the controller in the pages template

```html
<!-- TeamPage.ss -->
<p>{$getExample}</p>
```
