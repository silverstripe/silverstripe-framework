jQuery UI DatePicker localization files for SilverStripe 3.0
------------------------------------------------------------
These files are adaptations of the official localization files that can be found here:
http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ui/i18n/

Day- and monthnames have been changed to match the values Zend Date uses, to make 
the following dateformats validate:

EEE:  weekday short
EEEE: weekday
MMM:  monthname short
MMMM: monthname

For locales for which no file exists (yet), the DatePicker will revert to a numeric 
format, that will validate, and after being saved will be displayed in the 
required format.

To create your own language fiel, download the original file from the URL above, 
find the Zend Date locale file in framework/Zend/Locale/Data and make sure that

- monthNames, monthNamesShort and dayNames are equivalent to Zend (Gregorian) names 
- dayNamesShort should be the first 3 characters of dayNames
